Instructions to Bidders (ITB)\\nInstructions to Bidders\\nA. GENERAL\\n1. Scope of Bid \\nand Bidding \\nProcess\\n1.1 The Purchaser named in the BDS and the SCC for GCC Clause \\n1.1 (b) (i), or its duly authorized Purchasing Agent if so \\nspecified in the BDS (interchangeably referred to as “the \\nPurchaser” in these Bidding Documents), invites bids for the \\nsupply and installation of the Information System (IS), as briefly \\ndescribed in the BDS and specified in greater detail in these \\nBidding Documents.\\n1.2 The title and identification number of the Invitation for Bids \\n(IFB) and resulting Contract(s) are provided in the BDS.\\n1.3 Throughout the Bidding Documents, the term \"in writing\" means \\ncommunicated in written form (e.g. by mail, e-mail, fax, telex) \\nwith proof of receipt, and the term \"days\" means calendar days \\nunless a different meaning is evident from the context.\\n1.4 If the BDS so provides, alternative procedures forming part or \\nall of what is commonly known as e-Tendering are available to \\nthe extent specified in, or referred to by, the BDS.\\n2. Source of \\nFunds\\n2.1 The Borrower named in the BDS has applied for or received a \\nloan or credit (as identified in the BDS, and called a “loan” in \\nthese Bidding Documents) from the International Bank for \\nReconstruction and Development or the International \\nDevelopment Association (called “the Bank” in these Bidding \\nDocuments) equivalent to the amount indicated in the BDS \\ntoward the cost of the Project specified in the BDS. The \\nBorrower intends to apply a portion of the proceeds of this loan \\nto eligible payments under the Contract for which these Bidding \\nDocuments are issued.\\n2.2 Payment by the Bank will be made only at the request of the \\nBorrower, or the Borrower’s executing agency, and upon \\napproval by the Bank in accordance with the terms and \\nconditions of the Loan Agreement, and will be subject in all \\nrespects to the terms and conditions of that agreement. The \\nLoan Agreement prohibits a withdrawal from the loan account \\nfor the purpose of any payment to persons or entities, or for any \\nimport of goods, if such payment or import, to the knowledge of \\nthe Bank, is prohibited by a decision of the United Nations \\nSecurity Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations. No party other than the Borrower shall derive \\nany rights from the Loan Agreement or have any claim to the \\nSection I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 11\\nloan proceeds.\\n3. Fraud and \\nCorruption\\n3.1 It is the Bank’s policy to require that Borrowers (including \\nbeneficiaries of Bank loans), as well as bidders, suppliers, and \\ncontractors and their subcontractors under Bank-financed \\ncontracts, observe the highest standard of ethics during the \\nprocurement and execution of such contracts.1\\nIn pursuance of \\nthis policy, the Bank:\\n(a) defines, for the purposes of this provision, the terms set \\nforth below as follows:\\n(i) “corrupt practice”2\\nis the offering, giving, receiving \\nor soliciting, directly or indirectly, of anything of \\nvalue to influence improperly the actions of another \\nparty;\\n(ii) “fraudulent practice”3\\nis any act or omission, \\nincluding a misrepresentation, that knowingly or \\nrecklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party \\nto obtain a financial or other benefit or to avoid an \\nobligation;\\n(iii) “collusive practice”4\\nis an arrangement between two \\nor more parties designed to achieve an improper \\npurpose, including to influence improperly the \\nactions of another party;\\n(iv) “coercive practice”5\\nis impairing or harming, or \\nthreatening to impair or harm, directly or indirectly, \\nany party or the property of the party to influence \\nimproperly the actions of a party;\\n(v) “obstructive practice” is\\n(aa) deliberately destroying, falsifying, altering or \\nconcealing of evidence material to the \\ninvestigation or making false statements to \\n \\n1\\nIn this context, any action taken by a bidder, supplier, contractor, or a sub-contractor to influence the \\nprocurement process or contract execution for undue advantage is improper.\\n2\\n“Another party” refers to a public official acting in relation to the procurement process or contract \\nexecution]. In this context, “public official” includes World Bank staff and employees of other \\norganizations taking or reviewing procurement decisions.\\n3 A “party” refers to a public official; the terms “benefit” and “obligation” relate to the procurement process \\nor contract execution; and the “act or omission” is intended to influence the procurement process or \\ncontract execution.\\n4\\n“Parties” refers to participants in the procurement process (including public officials) attempting to \\nestablish bid prices at artificial, non competitive levels.\\n5 A “party” refers to a participant in the procurement process or contract execution.\\n12 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)\\ninvestigators in order to materially impede a \\nBank investigation into allegations of a \\ncorrupt, fraudulent, coercive or collusive \\npractice; and/or threatening, harassing or \\nintimidating any party to prevent it from \\ndisclosing its knowledge of matters relevant to \\nthe investigation or from pursuing the \\ninvestigation; or\\n(bb) acts intended to materially impede the exercise \\nof the Bank’s inspection and audit rights \\nprovided for under sub-clause 3.1 (e) below.\\n(b) will reject a proposal for award if it determines that the \\nbidder recommended for award has, directly or through an \\nagent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive \\nor obstructive practices in competing for the contract in \\nquestion;\\n(c) will cancel the portion of the loan allocated to a contract if \\nit determines at any time that representatives of the \\nBorrower or of a beneficiary of the loan engaged in \\ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices during \\nthe procurement or the execution of that contract, without \\nthe Borrower having taken timely and appropriate action \\nsatisfactory to the Bank to address such practices when \\nthey occur;\\n(d) will sanction a firm or individual, including declaring \\nineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, \\nto be awarded a Bank-financed contract if it at any time \\ndetermines that the firm has, directly or through an agent, \\nengaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or\\nobstructive practices in competing for, or in executing, a \\nBank-financed contract; and\\n(e) will have the right to require that a provision be included \\nin bidding documents and in contracts financed by a Bank \\nloan, requiring bidders, suppliers, and contractors and \\ntheir sub-contractors to permit the Bank to inspect their \\naccounts and records and other documents relating to the \\nbid submission and contract performance and to have \\nthem audited by auditors appointed by the Bank.\\n3.2 Furthermore, Bidders shall be aware of the provision stated in \\nClause 9.8 and Clause 41.2 of the General Conditions of Contract.\\n3.3 Any communications between the Bidder and the Purchaser \\nrelated to matters of alleged fraud or corruption must be made in \\nSection I.

Qualifications \\nof the Bidder\\n6.1 By submission of documentary evidence in its bid, the Bidder \\nmust establish to the Purchaser’s satisfaction:\\n(a) that it has the financial, technical, and production \\ncapability necessary to perform the Contract, meets the \\nqualification criteria specified in the BDS, and has a \\nsuccessful performance history. If a prequalification \\nprocess has been undertaken for the Contract(s) for which \\nthese Bidding Documents have been issued, the Bidder \\nshall, as part of its bid, update any information submitted \\nwith its application for prequalification;\\n(For the purposes of establishing a Bidder’s qualifications, \\nand unless stated to the contrary in the BDS, the \\nexperience and / or resources of any Subcontractor will \\nnot contribute to the Bidder’s qualifications; only those of \\na Joint Venture partner will be considered.)\\n(b) that, in the case of a Bidder offering to supply key goods \\ncomponents of the Information System, as identified in \\nthe BDS, that the Bidder does not itself produce, the \\nBidder is duly authorized by the producer to supply those \\ncomponents in the Purchaser’s country under the \\nContract(s) that may result from this bidding; (This will be \\naccomplished by including Manufacturer’s Authorizations \\nin the bid, based on the sample found in Section VII.)\\n(c) that, if a Bidder proposes Subcontractors for key services \\nif and as identified in the BDS, these Subcontractors \\nhave agreed in writing to serve for the Bidder under the \\nContract(s) that may result from this bidding; and\\n(d) that, in the case of a Bidder not doing business within the \\n16 Section I.

If, \\nas a result of the bid opening pursuant to ITB Clause 24, \\nthis requirement is not met, all bids involving the firm as a \\nsingle Bidder or Joint Venture partner will be disqualified;\\n(f) all partners of the Joint Venture shall be liable jointly and \\nseverally for the execution of the Contract in accordance \\nwith the Contract terms, and a statement to this effect shall \\nbe included in the authorization mentioned under ITB \\nClause 6.2 (b) above, in the bid as well as in the Contract \\n(in case of a successful bid).\\n6.3 If a Bidder intends to subcontract major items of supply or \\nservices, it shall include in the bid details of the name and \\nnationality of the proposed Subcontractor for each of those items \\nand shall be responsible for ensuring that any Subcontractor \\nproposed complies with the requirements of ITB Clause 4, and \\nthat any Goods or Services components of the Information \\nSection I.

Bidders are free to list \\nmore than one Subcontractor against each item. Quoted rates \\nand prices will be deemed to apply, whichever Subcontractor is \\nappointed, and no adjustment of the rates or prices will be \\npermitted. The Purchaser reserves the right to delete any \\nproposed Subcontractor from the list. This shall be done prior to \\nContract signature, by deleting such unacceptable \\nSubcontractors from Appendix 3 to the Contract Agreement, \\nwhich shall list the approved Subcontractors for each item prior \\nto Contract signature. Subsequent additions and deletions from \\nthe list of approved Subcontractors shall be performed in \\naccordance with GCC Clause 20 (as revised in the SCC, if \\napplicable) and Appendix 3 to the Contract Agreement.\\nFor the purposes of these Bidding Documents, a Subcontractor is \\nany vendor or service provider with whom the Bidder contracts \\nfor the supply or execution of any part of the Information \\nSystem to be provided by the Bidder under the Contract (such as \\nthe supply of major hardware, software, or other components of \\nthe required Information Technologies specified, or the \\nperformance of related Services, e.g., software development, \\ntransportation, installation, customization, integration, \\ncommissioning, training, technical support, maintenance, repair, \\netc.).\\n6.4 A firm which is a Bidder, whether as a single Bidder or as a \\npartner in a Joint Venture, cannot be a Subcontractor in other \\nbids, except for the supply of commercially available hardware \\nor software by the firm, as well as purely incidental services \\nsuch as installation/configuration, routine training, and ongoing \\nmaintenance/support. If the BDS for ITB Clause 6.1 (a) allows \\nthe qualification of Subcontractors nominated for certain \\ncomponents to be taken into account in assessing the Bidder’s \\noverall qualifications, any Subcontractor so nominated by any \\nBidder is automatically disqualified from being a Bidder itself or \\na partner in a Joint Venture. The same will normally apply to \\nfirms that have provided Subcontractor agreements for certain \\nservices pursuant to ITB Clause 6.1 (c). Non-compliance may \\nresult in the rejection of all bids in which the affected firm \\nparticipates as Bidder or as partner in a Joint Venture. As long \\nas in compliance with these provisions, or as long as unaffected \\nby them due to not participating as Bidder or as partner in a Joint \\nVenture, a firm may be proposed as a Subcontractor in any \\nnumber of bids. If the BDS for ITB 28.1 permits the submission \\nof bids for Subsystems, lots, or slices, then the provisions of this \\n18 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)\\nClause 6.4 apply only to bids for the same Subsystem(s), lot(s), \\nor slice(s);\\n7. Cost of \\nBidding\\n7.1 The Bidder shall bear all costs associated with the preparation \\nand submission of its bid, and the Purchaser will in no case be \\nresponsible or liable for those costs.\\n8. Site Visit 8.1 The Bidder may wish to visit and examine the site or sites of the \\nInformation System and obtain for itself, at its own \\nresponsibility and risk, all information that may be necessary for \\npreparing the bid and entering into the Contract. The costs of \\nvisiting the site or sites shall be at the Bidder’s own expense.\\n8.2 The Purchaser will arrange for the Bidder and any of its \\npersonnel or agents to gain access to the relevant site or sites, \\nprovided that the Bidder gives the Purchaser adequate notice of a \\nproposed visit of at least fourteen (14) days. Alternatively, the \\nPurchaser may organize a site visit or visits concurrently with \\nthe pre-bid meeting, as specified in the BDS for ITB Clause \\n10.2. Failure of a Bidder to make a site visit will not be a cause \\nfor its disqualification.\\n8.3 No site visits shall be arranged or scheduled after the deadline \\nfor the submission of the Bids and prior to the award of \\nContract.\\nB. THE BIDDING DOCUMENTS\\n9. Content of \\nBidding \\nDocuments\\n9.1 The contents of the Bidding Documents are listed below and \\nshould be read in conjunction with any addenda issued in \\naccordance with ITB Clause 11:\\nSection I Instructions to Bidders (ITB)\\nSection II Bid Data Sheet (BDS)\\nSection III Eligible Countries for the Provision of Goods, \\nWorks, and Services in Bank-Financed \\nProcurement \\nSection IV General Conditions of Contract (GCC)\\nSection V Special Conditions of Contract (SCC)\\nSection VI Technical Requirements (including \\nImplementation Schedule)\\nSection VII Sample Forms\\n9.2 Bidders are expected to examine all instructions, forms, terms, \\nSection I.

The Purchaser will respond in \\nwriting to any request for clarification or modification of the \\nBidding Documents that it receives no later than twenty-one (21) \\ndays prior to the deadline for submission of bids prescribed by \\nthe Purchaser. Copies of the Purchaser’s response (including an \\nexplanation of the query but not identifying its source) will be \\nsent to all prospective Bidders that received the Bidding \\nDocuments from the Purchaser.\\n10.2 When specified in the BDS, the Purchaser will organize and \\nBidders are welcome to attend a pre-bid meeting at the time and \\nplace indicated in the BDS.

Any modification to the \\nBidding Documents listed in ITB Clause 9.1, which may \\nbecome necessary as a result of the pre-bid meeting, shall be \\nmade by the Purchaser exclusively by issuing an Addendum \\npursuant to ITB Clause 11 and not through the minutes of the \\npre-bid meeting.\\n20 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)\\n11. Amendment of \\nBidding \\nDocuments\\n11.1 At any time prior to the deadline for submission of bids, the \\nPurchaser may, for any reason, whether at its own initiative or in \\nresponse to a clarification requested by a prospective Bidder, \\namend the Bidding Documents.

The request \\nand the responses to the request shall be made in writing. A \\nBidder may refuse the request without risking execution of the \\nBid-Securing Declaration or forfeiting the Bid Security, but in \\nthis case the bid will be out of the competition for the award. \\nExcept as provided in ITB Clause 18.3, a Bidder agreeing to the \\nSection I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 29\\nrequest will not be required or permitted to modify its bid, but \\nwill be required to ensure that the bid remains secured for a \\ncorrespondingly longer period, pursuant to ITB Clause 17.2.\\n18.3 In the case of fixed price contracts, if the award is delayed by a \\nperiod exceeding fifty-six (56) days beyond the expiry of the \\ninitial bid validity, the contract price will be adjusted as \\nspecified in the request for extension.

BID OPENING AND EVALUATION\\n24. Opening of \\nBids by \\nPurchaser\\n24.1 The Purchaser will open all bids, including withdrawals, \\nsubstitutions, and modifications, in public, in the presence of \\nBidders’ representatives who choose to attend, at the time, on \\n32 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)\\nthe date and at the place specified in the BDS. Bidders’ \\nrepresentatives shall sign a register as proof of their attendance.\\n24.2 First, envelopes marked “BID WITHDRAWAL NOTICE” shall be \\nopened and read out and the envelope with the corresponding \\nbid shall not be opened, but returned to the Bidder. No bid \\nwithdrawal shall be permitted unless the corresponding \\nwithdrawal notice contains a valid authorization to request the \\nwithdrawal and is read out at bid opening. Next, envelopes \\nmarked “BID SUBSTITUTION NOTICE” shall be opened and read \\nout and exchanged with the corresponding bid being substituted, \\nand the substituted bid shall not be opened, but returned to the \\nBidder. No bid substitution shall be permitted unless the \\ncorresponding substitution notice contains a valid authorization \\nto request the substitution and is read out at bid opening. \\nEnvelopes marked “BID MODIFICATION NOTICE” shall be opened \\nand read out with the corresponding bid. No bid modification \\nshall be permitted unless the corresponding modification notice \\ncontains a valid authorization to request the modification and is \\nread out at bid opening. Only bids that are opened and read out \\nat bid opening shall be considered further.\\n24.3 Bids shall be opened one at a time, reading out: the name of the \\nBidder and whether there is a modification; the total bid price\\nincluding any unconditional discounts, and, if applicable, the \\nprices and unconditional discounts for Subsystems, lots, or \\nslices; the presence or absence of a Bid-Securing Declaration or \\na Bid Security if one was required; any conditional discounts \\noffered for the award of more than one Subsystem, lot, or slice, \\nif the BDS for ITB Clause 28.1 permits such discounts to be \\nconsidered in the bid evaluation; and any other such details as \\nthe Purchaser may consider appropriate. \\n24.4 Bids and modifications that are not opened and read out at bid \\nopening shall not be considered for further evaluation, \\nirrespective of the circumstances. These bids, including any \\nbids validly withdrawn in accordance with ITB Clause 24.2, will \\npromptly be returned, unopened, to their Bidders.\\n24.5 The Purchaser will prepare minutes of the bid opening, \\nincluding the information disclosed to those present in \\naccordance with ITB Clause 24.3. The minutes will promptly be \\ndistributed to all Bidders that met the deadline for submitting \\nbids.\\n25. Clarification of \\nBids\\n25.1 During the bid evaluation, the Purchaser may, at its discretion, \\nask the Bidder for a clarification of its bid. The request for \\nclarification and the response shall be in writing, and no change \\nSection I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 33\\nin the price or substance of the bid shall be sought, offered, or \\npermitted.\\n26. Preliminary \\nExamination \\nof Bids\\n26.1 The Purchaser will examine the bids to determine whether they \\nare complete, whether any computational errors have been \\nmade, whether required sureties have been furnished, whether \\nthe documents have been properly signed, and whether the bids \\nare generally in order. In the case where a prequalification \\nprocess has been undertaken for the Contract(s) for which these \\nBidding Documents have been issued, the Purchaser will ensure \\nthat each bid is from a prequalified Bidder, and in the case of a \\nJoint Venture, that partners and structure of the Joint Venture \\nare unchanged from those in the prequalification.\\n26.2 Arithmetical errors will be rectified on the following basis. If \\nthere is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price, \\nwhich is obtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, or \\nbetween added or subtracted subtotals and totals, the unit or \\nsubtotal price shall prevail and the total price shall be corrected, \\nunless in the opinion of the Purchaser there is an obvious \\nmisplacement of the decimal point in the unit or subtotal prices, \\nin which case the line item total as quoted shall govern and the \\nunit price or sub-total shall be corrected. If there is a \\ndiscrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words \\nwill prevail, unless the discrepancy is the result of a typo/error \\nfor which the correction is self-evident to the Purchaser. If the \\nBidder with the Lowest Evaluated Bid does not accept the \\ncorrection of errors, the bid shall be rejected.\\n26.3 The Purchaser may waive any minor informality, \\nnonconformity, or irregularity in a bid that does not constitute a \\nmaterial deviation, provided such waiver does not prejudice or \\naffect the relative ranking of any Bidder.\\n26.4 Prior to the detailed evaluation, the Purchaser will determine \\nwhether each bid is of acceptable quality, is complete, and is \\nsubstantially responsive to the Bidding Documents. For \\npurposes of this determination, a substantially responsive bid is \\none that conforms to all the terms, conditions, and specifications \\nof the Bidding Documents without material deviations, \\nexceptions, objections, conditionalities, or reservations. A \\nmaterial deviation, exception, objection, conditionality, or \\nreservation is one: (i) that limits in any substantial way the \\nscope, quality, or performance of the Information System; or \\n(ii) that limits, in any substantial way that is inconsistent with \\nthe Bidding Documents, the Purchaser’s rights or the successful \\nBidder’s obligations under the Contract; or (iii) the acceptance \\n34 Section I.

General Conditions of Contract 117\\nand related Services in accordance with \\nGCC Clause 23 (Product Upgrades).\\n39.1.2 The Supplier may from time to time during its \\nperformance of the Contract propose to the \\nPurchaser (with a copy to the Project Manager) any \\nChange that the Supplier considers necessary or \\ndesirable to improve the quality or efficiency of the \\nSystem. The Purchaser may at its discretion \\napprove or reject any Change proposed by the \\nSupplier.\\n39.1.3 Notwithstanding GCC Clauses 39.1.1 and 39.1.2, no \\nchange made necessary because of any default of the \\nSupplier in the performance of its obligations under \\nthe Contract shall be deemed to be a Change, and \\nsuch change shall not result in any adjustment of the \\nContract Price or the Time for Achieving \\nOperational Acceptance.\\n39.1.4 The procedure on how to proceed with and execute \\nChanges is specified in GCC Clauses 39.2 and 39.3, \\nand further details and sample forms are provided in \\nthe Sample Forms Section in the Bidding \\nDocuments.\\n39.1.5 Moreover, the Purchaser and Supplier will agree, \\nduring development of the Project Plan, to a date \\nprior to the scheduled date for Operational \\nAcceptance, after which the Technical Requirements \\nfor the System shall be “frozen.” Any Change \\ninitiated after this time will be dealt with after \\nOperational Acceptance.\\n39.2 Changes Originating from Purchaser\\n39.2.1 If the Purchaser proposes a Change pursuant to GCC \\nClauses 39.1.1, it shall send to the Supplier a \\n“Request for Change Proposal,” requiring the \\nSupplier to prepare and furnish to the Project \\nManager as soon as reasonably practicable a \\n“Change Proposal,” which shall include the \\nfollowing:\\n(a) brief description of the Change;\\n(b) impact on the Time for Achieving Operational \\nAcceptance;\\n118 Section IV.

If the Purchaser accepts the Supplier’s \\nobjection, the Purchaser shall withdraw the proposed \\nChange and shall notify the Supplier in writing of its \\nacceptance.\\nThe Supplier’s failure to so object to a Request for \\nChange Proposal shall neither affect its right to \\nobject to any subsequent requested Changes or \\nChange Orders, nor affect its right to take into \\naccount, when making such subsequent objection, \\nthe percentage increase or decrease in the Contract \\nPrice that any Change not objected to by the \\nSupplier represents.\\n39.2.6 Upon receipt of the Change Proposal, the Purchaser \\nand the Supplier shall mutually agree upon all \\nmatters contained in the Change Proposal. Within \\nfourteen (14) days after such agreement, the \\nPurchaser shall, if it intends to proceed with the \\nChange, issue the Supplier a Change Order.

Under such circumstances, the \\nSupplier shall be entitled to reimbursement of all \\ncosts reasonably incurred by it in the preparation of \\nthe Change Proposal, provided that these do not \\nexceed the amount given by the Supplier in its \\nChange Estimate Proposal submitted in accordance \\nwith GCC Clause 39.2.2.\\n39.2.7 If the Purchaser and the Supplier cannot reach \\nagreement on the price for the Change, an equitable \\nadjustment to the Time for Achieving Operational \\nAcceptance, or any other matters identified in the \\nChange Proposal, the Change will not be \\n120 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract\\nimplemented. However, this provision does not \\nlimit the rights of either party under GCC Clause 6 \\n(Settlement of Disputes).\\n39.3 Changes Originating from Supplier\\nIf the Supplier proposes a Change pursuant to GCC \\nClause 39.1.2, the Supplier shall submit to the Project \\nManager a written “Application for Change Proposal,” \\ngiving reasons for the proposed Change and including the \\ninformation specified in GCC Clause 39.2.1. Upon receipt \\nof the Application for Change Proposal, the parties shall \\nfollow the procedures outlined in GCC Clauses 39.2.6 and \\n39.2.7. However, should the Purchaser choose not to \\nproceed or the Purchaser and the Supplier cannot come to \\nagreement on the change during any validity period that the \\nSupplier may specify in its Application for Change Proposal, \\nthe Supplier shall not be entitled to recover the costs of \\npreparing the Application for Change Proposal, unless \\nsubject to an agreement between the Purchaser and the \\nSupplier to the contrary.\\n40. Extension of \\nTime for \\nAchieving \\nOperational \\nAcceptance\\n40.1 The time(s) for achieving Operational Acceptance specified \\nin the Schedule of Implementation shall be extended if the \\nSupplier is delayed or impeded in the performance of any of \\nits obligations under the Contract by reason of any of the \\nfollowing:\\n(a) any Change in the System as provided in GCC \\nClause 39 (Change in the Information System);\\n(b) any occurrence of Force Majeure as provided in GCC \\nClause 38 (Force Majeure); \\n(c) default of the Purchaser; or\\n(d) any other matter specifically mentioned in the \\nContract;\\nby such period as shall be fair and reasonable in all the \\ncircumstances and as shall fairly reflect the delay or \\nimpediment sustained by the Supplier.\\n40.2 Except where otherwise specifically provided in the \\nContract, the Supplier shall submit to the Project Manager a \\nnotice of a claim for an extension of the time for achieving \\nOperational Acceptance, together with particulars of the \\nevent or circumstance justifying such extension as soon as \\nreasonably practicable after the commencement of such \\nSection IV.

Technical Requirements 151\\nTechnical Requirements\\nA. BACKGROUND\\n1.0 The Purchaser\\n1.1 The Republic of Zambia in the field of public procurement, in recent years has made \\na significant progress especially in the field of legislation as the Public Procurement Act No. \\n12 of 2008 was enacted by the Parliament of Zambia and became operational on 8 December, \\n2008 with major reform tool of procurement reform through decentralization of procurement \\nby allowing procuring entities to procure themselves. The Act established Zambia Public \\nProcurement Authority (ZPPA) renaming existing Zambia National Tender Board. The \\nZPPA is an independent regulatory body with responsibility for policy, regulation, standard \\nsetting, compliance and performance monitoring, professional development, information \\nmanagement and dissemination in the field of public procurement. In line with the Act, the \\nPublic Procurement Regulations were released in 2011 through a Statutory Instrument. From \\nJanuary 1, 2013, ZPPA stopped handling procurements on behalf of Procuring Entities (PEs). \\nPEs with capacity undertake all procurement within their respective institutions. To facilitate \\nthese PEs for their compliance to the Act and Regulations, improve efficiency, enhance \\ntransparency, provide equity through competitive bidding, and adhere value for money in all \\nprocurements are major challenges for Zambia at this early stage. In order to support the \\neffort of the government in modernizing the public procurement to achieve basic objectives \\nand help enhance good governance in the public procurement sector, the Cooperating \\nPartners-financed Zambia: Public Financial Management Reform Programme (PFMRP) \\nincludes a component for improving the Electronic Procurement System of the Republic of \\nZambia. \\nZambia’s recent economic performance has been encouraging with a decade of rapid \\neconomic expansion with growth rates averaging 6 percent per annum during the latter half \\nof 2000s. In 2013 Zambia’s real GDP is projected to grow at 6.0 percent, much lower than \\nthe initially projected 7.8 percent.\\nDespite significant progress, there is still a lot of rooms for improvements in the public \\nprocurement system, in particular in the field of electronic services of public procurement (e\\x02procurement). To date information portal is available, which offers basic information relating \\nto the public procurement act, regulations, circulars, templates, standard solicitation \\ndocuments, and basic guides to bidders. \\nThe e-procurement system will support procuring entities to purchase goods, works and \\nservices faster and more efficiently and, more generally, increase the efficiency and \\neffectiveness of public procurement. \\nThe component for e-Procurement System includes the enhancement of existing ZPPA \\nwebsite, development of an end-to-end e-Procurement system with all processes involved in \\nprocurement lifecycle and supported by Public Procurement Act and Public Procurement \\nRegulations, international best practices including framework agreements, and support to \\nestablish e-procurement data center as well as required capacity building activities. \\n152 Section VI. Technical Requirements\\nTo this end the project seeks to procure and implement an e-Procurement system for the \\nRepublic of Zambia to be used by all the stakeholders for the procurement of goods, works \\nand services in compliance with the Public Procurement Acts, Regulations, and other \\nsubsequent amendments; enhance ZPPA website and establish e-Procurement data center.\\nThe e-Procurement Software supplier has two options for delivery of the e-Procurement \\nsoftware component. The e-Procurement System can be custom developed or can deliver \\nof a commercial Off-The-Shelf e-procurement solution with required customization and \\nconfiguration. In either case, the e-Procurement system shall comply with all the business, \\ntechnical and functional requirements stipulated in this document and other requirements \\nidentified and mutually agreed by the Supplier and the Purchaser.\\n1.2 Major Stakeholders and some definitions\\nThe ZPPA will be the lead agency for the operation of e-Procurement System in the Republic \\nof Zambia. All other PEs, and relevant government agencies, third party service providers, \\nAttorney General, National Council for Construction (NCC) and others will have their own \\ndedicated administrative dashboard in the e-Procurement System to carry out their mandated \\nfunctional activities available in the e-Procurement System. \\nZambia Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA): The ZPPA is an independent regulatory \\nbody with responsibility for policy, regulation, standard setting, compliance and performance \\nmonitoring, professional development, information management and dissemination in the \\nfield of public procurement.\\nAttorney-General (AG): Procuring Entity, before entering into any international agreement \\nrelating to procurement, should obtain the approval of the authority and advice of the \\nAttorney-General. Any agreement purportedly entered into without the approval of the \\nAttorney-General is void.\\nNational Council for Construction (NCC): The National Council for Construction (NCC) \\nis a statutory body set up under the National Council for Construction Act No. 13 of 2003 \\nwith the responsibility of providing for the promotion, development, training and regulation \\nof the construction industry in Zambia. Under the Act, the NCC is further charged with the \\nresponsibility of registering of contractors, affiliation of professional bodies or organizations \\nwhose members are engaged in activities related to the construction industry and to provide \\nfor matters connected with or incidental to the foregoing.\\nAppeals Committee (AP): The Appeals Committee (AP) a complaints review committee \\nformed under the ZPPA. It reviews all complaints addressed to the ZPPA in the field of \\npublic procurement concerning possible violation of the law.\\nDeviation Committee (DC): The Deviations Committee (DC) is a committee formed \\nunder ZPPA. It reviews applications for deviations and accreditation of alternative \\nprocurement systems.\\nProcuring Entity (PE): The Procuring Entity (PE) in Zambia means a Government agency \\nor parastatal body, or any other body or unit established and mandated by Government to \\ncarry out procurement using public fund. A PE shall be responsible for the management of all \\nSection VI. Technical Requirements 153\\nprocurement activities within its jurisdiction. There are 257 Procuring Entities in Zambia. \\nAccording to the act, the PE shall consist of:\\na) a Controlling Officer or Chief Executive Officer;\\nb) a Procurement Committee;\\nc) a Procurement Unit; and\\nd) User departments.\\nBidder: Bidder means a person or group of persons that offers to provide goods, works or \\nservices in response to an invitation from a procuring entity and includes, where applicable, a \\npotential bidder and applicant to pre-qualify.\\n2.0 Business Objectives of the Purchaser\\nPublic procurement is a key aspect of public administration that links the public financial \\nsystem with social and economic outcomes, and as such is a major determinant of the \\neffectiveness of the government, and of the quality of public services and infrastructure. \\ne-Procurement will create a procurement platform, based on the successful experience of the \\ninternational best practice. The objective of this activity is to make the procurement more \\nefficient, using the benefits of today’s electronic technology with a higher level of trust from \\nthe business sector and the public at large, based on demonstrating fair play, value for \\nmoney, open competition, and accountability. \\ne-Procurement acts as a catalyst to wider public sector reform, offering many advantages of \\nwider economic benefits, by providing greater management control and significant \\nreductions in acquisition costs on a sustainable basis. It represents both an opportunity for \\nprocurement reform and a change in the way procurement is conducted. The application of \\ntechnology to this area of the public sector has been recognized by many governments as one of the \\nmost effective means for promoting efficiency and transparency in public procurement. \\nThe Republic of Zambia has laid out its public sector procurement policy based on the guiding \\nprinciples, which include (i) economy; (ii) competition; (iii) efficiency; (iv) fairness; (v) transparency; \\n(vi) accountability; and (vii) value for money. \\n2.1 The e-Procurement system will provide a single portal to the Republic of Zambia and bring \\nunder electronic environment activities performed by the procurement related stakeholders by \\nintegrating them on a single electronic network. \\nAmong the key benefits the system will bring is a reduction in the administrative cost, eliminate \\ncostly overheads and thus further speed up the procurement process, greater transparency of the \\nprocess, better access to information and improved accuracy of procurements. The introduction of the \\ne-procurement system will require extensive training of public personnel and bidding community. \\nThe ZPPA will operate the e-Procurement system. The ZPPA holds the complete operation and \\nmanagement responsibility of e-Procurement System in coordination with all Procuring Entities and \\nstakeholders (i.e. Attorney-General, National Council for Construction (NCC), Banks and e-payment \\noperators, and others) for the implementation of e-Procurement System.\\nThe objectives of this assignment require a consultant to work with the ZPPA and stakeholders to \\ndevelop and implement an e-Procurement system for the Republic of Zambia. The system, under this \\nproject, will manage the procurement process and government purchases online; from the preparation \\n154 Section VI.

The e-Procurement system to be developed will have the following \\ncapabilities to carry out complete public procurements electronically, and include major modules but \\nnot limited to:\\n\\uf0b7 Registration system for Procuring Entities, and other users; \\nDesign interface/Integrate with Contractor Registration System of the \\nNational Council for Construction (NCC), and develop supplier and \\nConsultants Registration to be operated by ZPPA;\\n\\uf0b7 User-specific Administrative Dashboards;\\n\\uf0b7 E-Bidding (covering processes and procurement methods supported by public \\nprocurement law and regulations of the country from Annual Procurement \\nPlan to signing of contract); \\n\\uf0b7 Simplified Bidding (e-Quoting);\\n\\uf0b7 Framework Agreements and their management;\\n\\uf0b7 Contract Management;\\n\\uf0b7 Complaint Procedures handling;\\n\\uf0b7 E-Procurement Management and Performance Monitoring System (e\\x02PMPMS);\\n\\uf0b7 User Activities and System Audit trails, and \\n\\uf0b7 Online Help.\\nThe selected firm shall implement the e-Procurement System and also provide training, and relevant \\nsupport / maintenance during warranty period. The e-Procurement System should be in English \\nlanguage.\\nThe e-Procurement Software supplier has two options for delivery of the e-Procurement software \\ncomponent. The e-Procurement System can be custom developed or can deliver of a commercial \\nOff-The-Shelf e-procurement solution with required customization and configuration. In either \\ncase, the e-Procurement system shall comply with all the business, technical and functional \\nrequirements stipulated in this document and other requirements identified and mutually agreed by \\nthe Supplier and the Purchaser.\\nThis e-Procurement system shall be required to be interfaced with external systems for the \\nverification and information about Contractors, Business registration, National ID, tax and VAT \\nclearance, and daily information on currency exchange, if the services are available during the \\nimplementation of e-Procurement system.\\nThe implementation of the e-Procurement system will be in a phased manner starting initially with the \\nlaunch of common e-Bidding methods, e-Framework Agreements and e-PMIS with readily available \\nexternal interfaces. However, all the modules including e-Contract management and other \\nfunctionalities will be procured, developed and customized/configured at the same time. The Supplier \\nshall ensure in its design that the application could be implemented in the phased manner, based on \\nthe government decision on their implementation. \\nSection VI.

Without providing sufficient clear \\ndetail, Suppliers run the risk of their bids being declared non-responsive. \\n5.1.1 To assist in the bid evaluation, the detailed descriptions shall be organized and \\ncross referenced in the same manner as the Bidder’s item-by-item \\ncommentary on the Technical Requirements described in Section 5.2 below. \\nAll information provided by cross reference must, at a minimum, include clear \\ntitles and page numbers. \\n5.1.2 List of users currently utilizing the e-Procurement system developed or \\ncustomized by the bidder, indicating which of them are also utilizing \\n5.2 Item-by-Item Commentary on the Technical Requirements\\n5.2.0 The Bidder must provide an item-by-item commentary on the Purchaser’s \\nTechnical Requirements, demonstrating the substantial responsiveness of the \\noverall design of the System and the individual Information Technologies, \\nGoods, and Services offered to those Requirements, see ITB Clause 16.2 (b).\\n5.2.1 In demonstrating the responsiveness of its bid, the Bidder is strongly urged to \\nuse the Technical Responsiveness Checklist provided in Section G below. \\nFailure to do so, increases significantly the risk that the Bidder’s Technical \\nBid will be declared technically non-responsive. Among other things, the \\nchecklist shall contain explicit cross references to the relevant pages in the \\nBidder’s Technical Bid. \\n5.3 Preliminary Project Plan\\n5.3.0 The Bidder must prepare a Preliminary Project Plan describing, among other \\nthings, the methods and human and material resources that the Bidder \\nproposes to employ in the design, management, coordination, and execution \\nof all its responsibilities, if awarded the Contract, as well as the estimated \\nduration and completion date for each major activity. The Preliminary Project \\nPlan must also address the topics and points of emphasis specified in SCC \\nClause 19, and point 4.1 above. \\n5.4 Confirmation of Responsibility for Integration and Interoperability of \\nInformation Technologies\\n5.4.0 The Bidder must submit a written confirmation that, if awarded the Contract, \\nit shall accept responsibility for successful integration and interoperability of \\nall the proposed Information Technologies included in the System, as further \\nspecified in the Bidding Document.\\nSection VI. Technical Requirements 215\\nG. TECHNICAL RESPONSIVENESS CHECKLIST\\nNote on Preparation of the Checklist for Purchasers: The following is a sample format that is \\ndesigned to help Bidders quickly understand: \\n(a) the Technical Specification given in the Technical Requirements; \\n(b) whether each Requirement is mandatory or only “preferred”; and \\n(c) to ensure that each Bidder includes along with a specific response to the Purchaser, a \\ncross reference to the supporting information provided elsewhere in its Technical \\nBid. \\nIt is important that the tables be prepared carefully and completely, with accurate references to the \\nrelevant section and paragraph numbers in the Technical Requirements so that Bidders will be more \\nlikely to submit complete information, particularly regarding the mandatory and scored \\nRequirements. In preparing each Checklist entry, Purchasers shall start with an abbreviated text of \\neach Requirement so that Bidders can quickly confirm that they are responding to the right \\nRequirement. Inconsistencies between the Checklist and the referenced section in the Technical \\nRequirements shall be avoided. Giving Bidders a revisable, “electronic” version of the Checklist as \\npart of the Bidding Document will enhance the completeness of bids.\\n216 Section VI. Technical Requirements\\nTechnical Responsiveness Checklist\\nNote to Bidders: The following Checklist is provided to help the Bidder organize and \\nconsistently present its Technical Bid. For each of the following Technical Requirements, \\nthe Bidder must describe how its Technical Bid responds to each Requirement. In addition, \\nthe Bidder must provide cross references to the relevant supporting information, if any, \\nincluded in the bid. The cross reference shall identify the relevant document(s), page \\nnumber(s), and paragraph(s). The Technical Responsiveness Checklist does not supersede \\nthe rest of the Technical Requirements (or any other part of the Bidding Documents). If a \\nrequirement is not mentioned in the Checklist that does not relieve the Bidder from the \\nresponsibility of including supporting evidence of compliance with that other requirement in \\nits Technical Bid. One- or two-word responses (e.g. “Yes,” “No,” “Will comply,” etc.) are \\nnormally not sufficient to confirm technical responsiveness with Technical Requirements.\\n1.1 BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS TO BE MET BY THE SYSTEM\\nReq. 1.1.1 Key Requirements Mandatory\\nBidder’s technical reasons supporting compliance: \\nBidder’s cross references to supporting information in Technical Bid:\\n1.2.1 CENTRALIZED REGISTRATION \\n1.2.1.1 Bidders Registration\\nTech.

SAMPLE FORMS\\nNotes to Bidders on working with the Sample Forms\\nThe Purchaser has prepared the forms in this section of the Bidding Documents to suit \\nthe specific requirements of the System being procured. They are derived from the forms \\ncontained in the World Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents for the Supply and Installation \\nof Information Systems. In its bid, the Bidder must use these forms (or forms that present in \\nthe same sequence substantially the same information). Bidders shall not introduce changes \\nwithout the Purchaser’s prior written consent (which may also require the clearance of the \\nWorld Bank). If the Bidder has a question regarding the meaning or appropriateness of the \\ncontents or format of the forms and/or the instructions contained in them, these questions \\nshall be brought to the Purchaser’s attention as soon as possible during the bid clarification \\nprocess, either at the pre-bid meeting or by addressing them to the Purchaser in writing \\npursuant to ITB Clause 10.\\nThe Purchaser has tried to provide explanatory text and instructions to help the \\nBidder prepare the forms accurately and completely. The instructions that appear directly on \\nthe forms themselves are indicated by use of typographical aides such as italicized text within \\nsquare brackets as is shown in the following example taken from the Bid Submission Form:\\nDuly authorized to sign this bid for and on behalf of [ insert: name of Bidder ]\\nIn preparing its bid, the Bidder must ensure all such information is provided and that \\nthe typographical aides are removed.\\nThe sample forms provide a standard set of documents that support the procurement \\nprocess as it moves forward from the stage of bidding, through Contract formation and onto \\nContract performance. The first set of forms must be completed and submitted as part of the \\nbid prior to the deadline for bid submission. These include: (i) the Bid Submission Form; (ii) \\nthe Price Schedules; (iii) the Manufacturer’s Authorizations and key Subcontractor \\nagreements; (iv) the List of Proposed Subcontractors; (v) the form(s) for securing the bid (if \\nand as required); and other forms as found in sub-sections 1 through 4 of this Section VII of \\nthe Bidding Documents.\\n\\uf0b7 Bid Submission Form: In addition to being the place where official confirmation of \\nthe bid price, the currency breakdown, the completion date(s), and other important \\nContract details are expressed, the Bid Submission Form is also used by the Bidder to \\nconfirm - in case adjudication applies in this Contract - its acceptance of the \\nPurchaser’s proposed Adjudicator, or to propose an alternative. If the bid is being \\nsubmitted on behalf of a Joint Venture, it is essential that the Bid Submission Form be \\nsigned by the partner in charge and that it be supported by the authorizations and \\npower of attorney required pursuant to ITB Clause 6.2. Given widespread concern \\nabout illegal use of licensed software, Bidders will be asked to certify in the Bid \\nSubmission Form that either the Software included in the bid was developed and is \\nowned by the Bidder, or, if not, the Software is covered by valid licenses with the \\nproprietor of the Software.\\n230 Section VII. Sample Forms\\n\\uf0b7 Price Schedules: The prices quoted in the Price Schedules shall constitute full and fair \\ncompensation for supply, installation, and achieving Operational Acceptance of the \\nSystem as described in the Technical Requirements based on the Implementation \\nSchedule, and the terms and conditions of the proposed Contract as set forth in the \\nBidding Documents. Prices shall be given for each line item provided in the \\nSchedules, with costs carefully aggregated first at the Subsystem level and then for \\nthe entire System. If the Price Schedules provide only a summary breakdown of \\nitems and components, or do not cover some items unique to the Bidder’s specific \\ntechnical solution, the Bidder may extend the Schedules to capture those items or \\ncomponents. If supporting price and cost tables are needed for a full understanding of \\nthe bid, they shall be included.\\nArithmetical errors shall be avoided. If they occur, the Purchaser will correct them \\naccording to ITB Clause 26.2 (ITB Clause 38.2 in the two-stage SBD) without \\nconsulting the Bidder. Major omissions, inconsistencies, or lack of substantiating \\ndetail can lead to rejection of a bid for commercial non-responsiveness. Presenting \\nprices according to the breakdown prescribed in the Price Schedules is also essential \\nfor another reason. If a bid does not separate prices in the prescribed way, and, as a \\nresult, the Purchaser cannot apply the domestic preference provision described in ITB \\nClause 29 (ITB Clause 41 in the two-stage SBD), if they are applicable in this \\nbidding, the Bidder will lose the benefit of the preference. Once bids are opened, \\nnone of these problems can be rectified. At that stage, Bidders are not permitted to \\nchange their bid prices to overcome errors or omissions.\\n\\uf0b7 Manufacturer’s Authorizations and written agreements by key Subcontractors: In \\naccordance with ITB Clauses 6.1 (b) and (c), a Bidder may be required to submit, as \\npart of its bid, Manufacturer’s Authorizations in the format provided in the Bidding \\nDocuments, and agreements by Subcontractors proposed for key services, for all \\nitems specified in the Bid Data Sheet. There is no particular format (or sample form) \\nfor Subcontractor agreements.\\n\\uf0b7 List of Proposed Subcontractors: In accordance with ITB Clause 6.3, a Bidder must \\nsubmit, as part of its bid, a list of proposed subcontracts for major items of \\nTechnologies, Goods, and/or Services. The list shall also include the names and \\nplaces of registration of the Subcontractors proposed for each item and a summary of \\ntheir qualifications.\\n\\uf0b7 List of Software and Materials: In accordance with ITB Clause 13.1 (e) (vi) (ITB \\nClauses 13.1 (c) (vi) and 25.1 (e) (vi) in the two-stage SBD), Bidders must submit, as \\npart of their bids, lists of all the Software included in the bid assigned to one of the \\nfollowing categories: (A) System, General-Purpose, or Application Software; or \\n(B) Standard or Custom Software. Bidders must also submit a list of all Custom \\nMaterials. If provided for in the Bid Data Sheet, the Purchaser may reserve the right \\nto reassign certain key Software to a different category.\\n\\uf0b7 Qualification information forms: In accordance with ITB Clause 6, the Purchaser \\nwill determine whether the Bidder is qualified to undertake the Contract. This entails \\nfinancial, technical as well as performance history criteria which are specified in the \\nBDS for ITB Clause 6. The Bidder must provide the necessary information for the \\nSection VII. Sample Forms 231\\nPurchaser to make this assessment through the forms in this sub-section. The forms \\ncontain additional detailed instructions which the Bidder must follow.\\n\\uf0b7 Securing the bid: If the BDS for ITB Clause 17 (ITB Clause 29 in the two-stage \\nSBD) requires that bids be secured, the Bidder shall do so in accordance with the type \\nand details specified in the same ITB/BDS Clause, either using the form(s) included \\nin these Sample Forms or using another form acceptable to the Purchaser. If a Bidder \\nwishes to use an alternative form, it shall ensure that the revised format provides \\nsubstantially the same protection as the standard format; failing that, the Bidder runs \\nthe risk of rejection for commercial non-responsiveness.\\nBidders need not provide the Performance Security and Advance Payment Security \\nwith their bids. Only the Bidder selected for award by the Purchaser will be required to \\nprovide these securities.\\nThe following forms are to be completed and submitted by the successful Bidder \\nfollowing notification of award: (i) Contract Agreement, with all Appendices; \\n(ii) Performance Security; and (iii) Advance Payment Security.\\n\\uf0b7 Contract Agreement: In addition to specifying the parties and the Contract Price, the \\nContract Agreement is where the: (i) Supplier Representative; (ii) if applicable, \\nagreed Adjudicator and his/her compensation; and (iii) the List of Approved \\nSubcontractors are specified. In addition, modifications to the successful Bidder’s \\nBid Price Schedules are attached to the Agreement. These contain corrections and \\nadjustments to the Supplier’s bid prices to correct errors, adjust the Contract Price to \\nreflect – if applicable - any extensions to bid validity beyond the last day of original \\nbid validity plus 56 days, etc.\\n\\uf0b7 Performance Security: Pursuant to GCC Clause 13.3, the successful Bidder is \\nrequired to provide the Performance Security in the form contained in this section of \\nthese Bidding Documents and in the amount specified in accordance with the SCC.\\n\\uf0b7 Advance Payment Security: Pursuant to GCC Clause 13.2, the successful Bidder is \\nrequired to provide a bank guarantee for the full amount of the Advance Payment - if \\nan Advance Payment is specified in the SCC for GCC 12.1 - in the form contained in \\nthis section of these Bidding Documents or another form acceptable to the Purchaser. \\nIf a Bidder wishes to propose a different Advance Payment Security form, it shall \\nsubmit a copy to the Purchaser promptly for review and confirmation of acceptability \\nbefore the bid submission deadline.\\nThe Purchaser and Supplier will use the following additional forms during Contract \\nimplementation to formalize or certify important Contract events: (i) the Installation and \\nOperational Acceptance Certificates; and (ii) the various Change Order forms. These and the \\nprocedures for their use during performance of the Contract are included in the Bidding \\nDocuments for the information of Bidders.\\n232 Section VII.

Sample Forms\\n2. PRICE SCHEDULE FORMS\\nNote: in information systems procurement, the Contract Price (and payment schedule) shall be linked \\nas much as possible to achievement of operational capabilities, not just to the physical delivery of \\ntechnology. \\nSection VII. Sample Forms 239\\n2.1 Preamble\\nNote: Purchasers shall highlight any special requirements of the System and Contract in a Preamble \\nto the Price Schedules. The following is an example of one such preamble.\\nGeneral\\n1. The Price Schedules are divided into separate Schedules as follows:\\n2.2 Grand Summary Cost Table\\n2.3 Supply and Installation Cost Summary Table\\n2.4 Recurrent Cost Summary Table\\n2.5 Supply and Installation Cost Sub-Table(s)\\n2.6 Recurrent Cost Sub-Tables(s)\\n2.7 Country of Origin Code Table\\n[ insert: any other Schedules as appropriate ]\\n2. The Schedules do not generally give a full description of the information technologies \\nto be supplied, installed, and operationally accepted, or the Services to be performed \\nunder each item. However, it is assumed that Bidders shall have read the Technical \\nRequirements and other sections of these Bidding Documents to ascertain the full scope \\nof the requirements associated with each item prior to filling in the rates and prices. \\nThe quoted rates and prices shall be deemed to cover the full scope of these Technical \\nRequirements, as well as overhead and profit.\\n3. If Bidders are unclear or uncertain as to the scope of any item, they shall seek \\nclarification in accordance with the Instructions to Bidders in the Bidding Documents \\nprior to submitting their bid.\\nPricing\\n4. Prices shall be filled in indelible ink, and any alterations necessary due to errors, etc., \\nshall be initialed by the Bidder. As specified in the Bid Data Sheet, prices shall be \\nfixed and firm for the duration of the Contract.\\n5. Bid prices shall be quoted in the manner indicated and in the currencies specified in \\nITB Clauses 14 and 15 (ITB Clauses 27 and 28 in the two-stage SBD). Prices must \\ncorrespond to items of the scope and quality defined in the Technical Requirements or \\nelsewhere in these Bidding Documents.\\n6. The Bidder must exercise great care in preparing its calculations, since there is no \\nopportunity to correct errors once the deadline for submission of bids has passed. A \\nsingle error in specifying a unit price can therefore change a Bidder’s overall total bid \\nprice substantially, make the bid noncompetitive, or subject the Bidder to possible loss. \\n240 Section VII. Sample Forms\\nThe Purchaser will correct any arithmetic error in accordance with the provisions of \\nITB Clause 26.2 (ITB Clause 38.2 in the two-stage SBD).\\n7. Payments will be made to the Supplier in the currency or currencies indicated under \\neach respective item. As specified in ITB Clause 15.1 (ITB Clause 28.1 in the two\\x02stage SBD), no more than three foreign currencies may be used. The price of an item \\nshall be unique regardless of installation site.\\nSection VII.
