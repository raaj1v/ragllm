10 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
Instructions to Bidders
A. GENERAL
1. Scope of Bid 
and Bidding 
Process
1.1 The Purchaser named in the BDS and the SCC for GCC Clause 
1.1 (b) (i), or its duly authorized Purchasing Agent if so 
specified in the BDS (interchangeably referred to as “the 
Purchaser” in these Bidding Documents), invites bids for the 
supply and installation of the Information System (IS), as briefly 
described in the BDS and specified in greater detail in these 
Bidding Documents.
1.2 The title and identification number of the Invitation for Bids 
(IFB) and resulting Contract(s) are provided in the BDS.
1.3 Throughout the Bidding Documents, the term "in writing" means 
communicated in written form (e.g. by mail, e-mail, fax, telex) 
with proof of receipt, and the term "days" means calendar days 
unless a different meaning is evident from the context.
1.4 If the BDS so provides, alternative procedures forming part or 
all of what is commonly known as e-Tendering are available to 
the extent specified in, or referred to by, the BDS.
2. Source of 
Funds
2.1 The Borrower named in the BDS has applied for or received a 
loan or credit (as identified in the BDS, and called a “loan” in 
these Bidding Documents) from the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development or the International 
Development Association (called “the Bank” in these Bidding 
Documents) equivalent to the amount indicated in the BDS 
toward the cost of the Project specified in the BDS. The 
Borrower intends to apply a portion of the proceeds of this loan 
to eligible payments under the Contract for which these Bidding 
Documents are issued.
2.2 Payment by the Bank will be made only at the request of the 
Borrower, or the Borrower’s executing agency, and upon 
approval by the Bank in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the Loan Agreement, and will be subject in all 
respects to the terms and conditions of that agreement. The 
Loan Agreement prohibits a withdrawal from the loan account 
for the purpose of any payment to persons or entities, or for any 
import of goods, if such payment or import, to the knowledge of 
the Bank, is prohibited by a decision of the United Nations 
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the 
United Nations. No party other than the Borrower shall derive 
any rights from the Loan Agreement or have any claim to the 
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 11
loan proceeds.
3. Fraud and 
Corruption
3.1 It is the Bank’s policy to require that Borrowers (including 
beneficiaries of Bank loans), as well as bidders, suppliers, and 
contractors and their subcontractors under Bank-financed 
contracts, observe the highest standard of ethics during the 
procurement and execution of such contracts.1
In pursuance of 
this policy, the Bank:
(a) defines, for the purposes of this provision, the terms set 
forth below as follows:
(i) “corrupt practice”2
is the offering, giving, receiving 
or soliciting, directly or indirectly, of anything of 
value to influence improperly the actions of another 
party;
(ii) “fraudulent practice”3
is any act or omission, 
including a misrepresentation, that knowingly or 
recklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party 
to obtain a financial or other benefit or to avoid an 
obligation;
(iii) “collusive practice”4
is an arrangement between two 
or more parties designed to achieve an improper 
purpose, including to influence improperly the 
actions of another party;
(iv) “coercive practice”5
is impairing or harming, or 
threatening to impair or harm, directly or indirectly, 
any party or the property of the party to influence 
improperly the actions of a party;
(v) “obstructive practice” is
(aa) deliberately destroying, falsifying, altering or 
concealing of evidence material to the 
investigation or making false statements to 
 
1
In this context, any action taken by a bidder, supplier, contractor, or a sub-contractor to influence the 
procurement process or contract execution for undue advantage is improper.
2
“Another party” refers to a public official acting in relation to the procurement process or contract 
execution]. In this context, “public official” includes World Bank staff and employees of other 
organizations taking or reviewing procurement decisions.
3 A “party” refers to a public official; the terms “benefit” and “obligation” relate to the procurement process 
or contract execution; and the “act or omission” is intended to influence the procurement process or 
contract execution.
4
“Parties” refers to participants in the procurement process (including public officials) attempting to 
establish bid prices at artificial, non competitive levels.
5 A “party” refers to a participant in the procurement process or contract execution.
12 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
investigators in order to materially impede a 
Bank investigation into allegations of a 
corrupt, fraudulent, coercive or collusive 
practice; and/or threatening, harassing or 
intimidating any party to prevent it from 
disclosing its knowledge of matters relevant to 
the investigation or from pursuing the 
investigation; or
(bb) acts intended to materially impede the exercise 
of the Bank’s inspection and audit rights 
provided for under sub-clause 3.1 (e) below.
(b) will reject a proposal for award if it determines that the 
bidder recommended for award has, directly or through an 
agent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive 
or obstructive practices in competing for the contract in 
question;
(c) will cancel the portion of the loan allocated to a contract if 
it determines at any time that representatives of the 
Borrower or of a beneficiary of the loan engaged in 
corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices during 
the procurement or the execution of that contract, without 
the Borrower having taken timely and appropriate action 
satisfactory to the Bank to address such practices when 
they occur;
(d) will sanction a firm or individual, including declaring 
ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, 
to be awarded a Bank-financed contract if it at any time 
determines that the firm has, directly or through an agent, 
engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or
obstructive practices in competing for, or in executing, a 
Bank-financed contract; and
(e) will have the right to require that a provision be included 
in bidding documents and in contracts financed by a Bank 
loan, requiring bidders, suppliers, and contractors and 
their sub-contractors to permit the Bank to inspect their 
accounts and records and other documents relating to the 
bid submission and contract performance and to have 
them audited by auditors appointed by the Bank.
3.2 Furthermore, Bidders shall be aware of the provision stated in 
Clause 9.8 and Clause 41.2 of the General Conditions of Contract.

it either is the owner of the Intellectual Property Rights in the 
hardware, software or materials offered, or that it has proper 
authorization and/or license to offer them from the owner of 
such rights. For the purpose of this Clause, Intellectual Property 
Rights shall be as defined in GCC Clause 1.1 (c) (xvii). Willful 
misrepresentation of these facts shall be considered a fraudulent 
practice subject to the provisions of Clauses 3.1 through 3.4 
above, without prejudice of other remedies that the Purchaser 
may take.
4. Eligible 
Bidders
4.1 A Bidder, and all parties constituting the Bidder, may have the

constituted, incorporated, or registered and operates in 
conformity with the provisions of the laws of that country. 
4.2 If a prequalification process has been undertaken for the 
Contract(s) for which these Bidding Documents have been 
issued, only those Bidders may participate that had been 
prequalified and continue to meet the eligibility criteria of this 
Clause. A prequalified Joint Venture may not change partners 
or its structure when submitting a bid. 
4.3 A firm may be excluded from bidding if:

services for the preparation of the design, specifications, or 
other documents to be used for the procurement of the

result of execution of a Bid-Securing Declaration pursuant 
to ITB Clause 17.6 in another Bank-financed procurement, 
or under a suspension by the Purchaser for other reasons 
that have been agreed by the Bank; or

above provisions of this Clause, may also not participate as a 
Joint Venture partner, or as Subcontractor for or supplier of 
goods, works or services. If a bid becomes materially 
incomplete after removing ineligible entities, the bid may be 
disqualified.
4.7 Bidders shall provide such evidence of their continued eligibility 
satisfactory to the Purchaser, as the Purchaser shall reasonably 
request.
5. Eligible Goods

a Joint Venture partner will be considered.)
(b) that, in the case of a Bidder offering to supply key goods 
components of the Information System, as identified in 
the BDS, that the Bidder does not itself produce, the 
Bidder is duly authorized by the producer to supply those

for a specific component of the Information System must

this requirement is not met, all bids involving the firm as a 
single Bidder or Joint Venture partner will be disqualified;
(f) all partners of the Joint Venture shall be liable jointly and 
severally for the execution of the Contract in accordance 
with the Contract terms, and a statement to this effect shall

System to be provided by the Bidder under the Contract (such as 
the supply of major hardware, software, or other components of 
the required Information Technologies specified, or the 
performance of related Services, e.g., software development, 
transportation, installation, customization, integration, 
commissioning, training, technical support, maintenance, repair, 
etc.).
6.4 A firm which is a Bidder, whether as a single Bidder or as a 
partner in a Joint Venture, cannot be a Subcontractor in other 
bids, except for the supply of commercially available hardware 
or software by the firm, as well as purely incidental services 
such as installation/configuration, routine training, and ongoing 
maintenance/support. If the BDS for ITB Clause 6.1 (a) allows 
the qualification of Subcontractors nominated for certain 
components to be taken into account in assessing the Bidder’s 
overall qualifications, any Subcontractor so nominated by any 
Bidder is automatically disqualified from being a Bidder itself or 
a partner in a Joint Venture. The same will normally apply to 
firms that have provided Subcontractor agreements for certain 
services pursuant to ITB Clause 6.1 (c). Non-compliance may 
result in the rejection of all bids in which the affected firm 
participates as Bidder or as partner in a Joint Venture. As long 
as in compliance with these provisions, or as long as unaffected 
by them due to not participating as Bidder or as partner in a Joint 
Venture, a firm may be proposed as a Subcontractor in any 
number of bids. If the BDS for ITB 28.1 permits the submission 
of bids for Subsystems, lots, or slices, then the provisions of this 
18 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
Clause 6.4 apply only to bids for the same Subsystem(s), lot(s), 
or slice(s);
7. Cost of 
Bidding
7.1 The Bidder shall bear all costs associated with the preparation 
and submission of its bid, and the Purchaser will in no case be 
responsible or liable for those costs.
8. Site Visit 8.1 The Bidder may wish to visit and examine the site or sites of the 
Information System and obtain for itself, at its own 
responsibility and risk, all information that may be necessary for 
preparing the bid and entering into the Contract. The costs of 
visiting the site or sites shall be at the Bidder’s own expense.
8.2 The Purchaser will arrange for the Bidder and any of its 
personnel or agents to gain access to the relevant site or sites, 
provided that the Bidder gives the Purchaser adequate notice of a 
proposed visit of at least fourteen (14) days. Alternatively, the 
Purchaser may organize a site visit or visits concurrently with 
the pre-bid meeting, as specified in the BDS for ITB Clause 
10.2. Failure of a Bidder to make a site visit will not be a cause 
for its disqualification.
8.3 No site visits shall be arranged or scheduled after the deadline 
for the submission of the Bids and prior to the award of 
Contract.
B. THE BIDDING DOCUMENTS
9. Content of

specifications, and other information in the Bidding Documents. 
Failure to furnish all information required by the Bidding 
Documents or to submit a bid not substantially responsive to the 
Bidding Documents in every respect will be at the Bidder’s risk 
and may result in the rejection of its bid.
9.3 The Invitation for Bids is not formally part of the Bidding 
Documents and is included for reference only. In case of 
inconsistencies, the actual Bidding Documents shall prevail.
10. Clarification of 
Bidding 
Documents 
and Pre-bid 
Meeting
10.1 A prospective Bidder requiring any clarification of the Bidding 
Documents may notify the Purchaser in writing at the 
Purchaser’s address and by one of the means indicated in the 
BDS. Similarly, if a Bidder feels that any important provision in 
the documents will be unacceptable, such an issue should be 
raised as soon as possible. The Purchaser will respond in 
writing to any request for clarification or modification of the 
Bidding Documents that it receives no later than twenty-one (21) 
days prior to the deadline for submission of bids prescribed by 
the Purchaser. Copies of the Purchaser’s response (including an 
explanation of the query but not identifying its source) will be 
sent to all prospective Bidders that received the Bidding 
Documents from the Purchaser.
10.2 When specified in the BDS, the Purchaser will organize and 
Bidders are welcome to attend a pre-bid meeting at the time and 
place indicated in the BDS. The purpose of the meeting will be 
to clarify issues and answer questions on any matter that may be 
raised at this stage, with particular attention to issues related to 
the Technical Requirements. Bidders are requested to submit 
any questions in writing to reach the Purchaser not later than one 
week before the meeting. Questions and answers will be 
transmitted in accordance with ITB Clause 10.1. Minutes of the 
meeting, including the questions raised and responses given, 
together with any responses prepared after the meeting, will be 
transmitted without delay to all those that received the Bidding 
Documents from the Purchaser. Any modification to the 
Bidding Documents listed in ITB Clause 9.1, which may 
become necessary as a result of the pre-bid meeting, shall be 
made by the Purchaser exclusively by issuing an Addendum 
pursuant to ITB Clause 11 and not through the minutes of the 
pre-bid meeting.
20 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
11. Amendment of 
Bidding 
Documents
11.1 At any time prior to the deadline for submission of bids, the 
Purchaser may, for any reason, whether at its own initiative or in 
response to a clarification requested by a prospective Bidder, 
amend the Bidding Documents. Later amendments on the same 
subject modify or replace earlier ones.
11.2 Amendments will be provided in the form of Addenda to the 
Bidding Documents, which will be sent in writing to all 
prospective Bidders that received the Bidding Documents from 
the Purchaser. Addenda will be binding on Bidders. Bidders are 
required to immediately acknowledge receipt of any such 
Addenda. It will be assumed that the amendments contained in 
such Addenda will have been taken into account by the Bidder 
in its bid.
11.3 In order to afford prospective Bidders reasonable time in which 
to take the amendment into account in preparing their bids, the 
Purchaser may, at its discretion, extend the deadline for the 
submission of bids, in which case, the Purchaser will notify all 
Bidders in writing of the extended deadline.

specified there. Any printed literature furnished by the Bidder 
as part of its bid may be in a language not specified in the BDS,

tables and summarized in the corresponding Cost Summary 
Tables in the same Section. Prices must be quoted in accordance 
with the instructions provided in Section VII for the various cost 
tables, in the manner specified below.
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 23
14.2 The price of items that the Bidder has left blank in the cost 
tables provided in Section VII shall be assumed to be included 
in the price of other items. Items omitted altogether from the 
cost tables shall be assumed to be omitted from the bid and, 
provided that the bid is substantially responsive, an adjustment 
to the bid price will be made during evaluation in accordance 
with ITB Clause 28.6 (c) (iii).
14.3 Unit prices must be quoted at a level of detail appropriate for 
calculation of any partial deliveries or partial payments under 
the contract, in accordance with the Implementation Schedule in 
Section VI, and with GCC and SCC Clause 12 – Terms of

(a) Goods supplied from outside the Purchaser’s country:
Unless otherwise specified in the BDS, the prices shall be 
quoted on a CIP (named place of destination) basis, 
exclusive of all taxes, stamps, duties, levies, and fees 
imposed in the Purchaser’s country. The named place of 
destination and special instructions for the contract of 
carriage are as specified in the BDS. In quoting the price, 
the Bidder shall be free to use transportation through 
carriers registered in any eligible countries. Similarly, the 
Bidder may obtain insurance services from any eligible

Country, shall be quoted on an EXW (ex factory, ex works, 
ex warehouse or off-the-shelf, as applicable) basis, 
including all customs duties, levies, fees, sales and other 
taxes incurred until delivery of the Goods, but excluding 
all VAT or sales and other taxes and duties/fees incurred 
for the Goods at the time of invoicing or sales transaction, 
if the Contract is awarded.
(c) Inland transportation:
Unless otherwise stated in the BDS, inland transportation, 
insurance and related local costs incidental to the delivery 
24 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
of the Goods to the designated Project Sites must be quoted 
separately as a Service item in accordance with ITB Clause 
14.5, whether the Goods are to be supplied locally or from 
outside the Purchaser’s country, except when these costs 
are already included in the price of the Goods, as is, e.g., 
the case, when ITB Clause 14.4 (a) specifies CIP, and the 
named places of destination are the Project Sites. 
14.5 The price of Services shall be quoted in total for each service 
(where appropriate, broken down into unit prices), separated into 
their local and foreign currency components. Prices must 
include all taxes, duties, levies and fees whatsoever, except only 
VAT or other indirect taxes, or stamp duties, that may be 
assessed and/or apply in the Purchaser’s country on/to the price 
of the Services invoiced to the Purchaser, if the Contract is 
awarded. Unless otherwise specified in the BDS, the prices 
must include all costs incidental to the performance of the 
Services, as incurred by the Supplier, such as travel, subsistence, 
office support, communications, translation, printing of 
materials, etc. Costs incidental to the delivery of the Services 
but incurred by the Purchaser or its staff, or by third parties, 
must be included in the price only to the extent such obligations 
are made explicit in these Bidding Documents (as, e.g., a 
requirement for the Bidder to include the travel and subsistence 
costs of trainees).
14.6 Prices for Recurrent Costs beyond the scope of warranty 
services to be incurred during the Warranty Period, defined in 
SCC Clause 29.4 and prices for Recurrent Costs to be incurred

the Recurrent Cost Summary Table in currency totals. Recurrent 
costs are all-inclusive of the costs of necessary Goods such as 
spare parts, software license renewals, labor, etc., needed for the 
continued and proper operation of the System and, if 
appropriate, of the Bidder’s own allowance for price increases.
14.7 Unless otherwise specified in the BDS, prices quoted by the 
Bidder shall be fixed during the Bidder’s performance of the 
Contract and not subject to increases on any account. Bids 
submitted that are subject to price adjustment will be rejected.

(a) The Bidder may quote its prices for all Information 
Technologies, associated Goods, and Services to be 
supplied from outside the Purchaser’s Country in the 
currencies of countries eligible according to Section III. If 
the Bidder wishes to be paid in a combination of different 
currencies, it must quote unit prices accordingly, but no 
more than three foreign currencies may be used.
(b) Unless otherwise specified in the BDS, the Bidder shall 
express its prices for such Information Technologies, 
associated Goods, and Services to be supplied locally (i.e., 
from within the Purchaser’s Country) in the currency of 
the Purchaser’s Country.
16. Documents 
Establishing 
the Conformity 
of the 
Information 
System to the 
Bidding 
Documents
16.1 Pursuant to ITB Clause 13.1 (e) (iv), the Bidder shall furnish, as 
part of its bid, documents establishing the conformity to the 
Bidding Documents of the Information System that the Bidder 
proposes to supply and install under the Contract.
16.2 The documentary evidence of conformity of the Information 
System to the Bidding Documents shall be in the form of written 
descriptions, literature, diagrams, certifications, and client 
references, including:
(a) the Bidder’s technical bid, i.e., a detailed description of the 
Bidder’s proposed technical solution conforming in all 
material aspects with the Technical Requirements (Section 
VI) and other parts of these Bidding Documents, overall as 
well as in regard to the essential technical and performance 
characteristics of each component making up the proposed 
Information System;
(b) an item-by-item commentary on the Purchaser’s Technical 
Requirements, demonstrating the substantial 
responsiveness of the Information System offered to those 
requirements. In demonstrating responsiveness, the 
commentary shall include explicit cross references to the 
relevant pages in the supporting materials included in the 
bid. Whenever a discrepancy arises between the item-byitem commentary and any catalogs, technical 
specifications, or other preprinted materials submitted with 
the bid, the item-by-item commentary shall prevail;
(c) a Preliminary Project Plan describing, among other things, 
the methods by which the Bidder will carry out its overall 
management and coordination responsibilities if awarded 
26 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
the Contract, and the human and other resources the Bidder 
proposes to use. The Plan should include a detailed 
Contract Implementation Schedule in bar chart form, 
showing the estimated duration, sequence, and 
interrelationship of all key activities needed to complete 
the Contract. The Preliminary Project Plan must also 
address any other topics specified in the BDS. In addition, 
the Preliminary Project Plan should state the Bidder’s 
assessment of what it expects the Purchaser and any other 
party involved in the implementation of the Information 
System to provide during implementation and how the 
Bidder proposes to coordinate the activities of all involved 
parties;
(d) a written confirmation that the Bidder accepts 
responsibility for the successful integration and interoperability of all components of the Information System as 
required by the Bidding Documents.
16.3 For purposes of the commentary to be furnished pursuant to ITB 
Clause 16.2 (b), the Bidder shall note that references to brand 
names or model numbers or national or proprietary standards 
designated by the Purchaser in its Technical Requirements are 
intended to be descriptive and not restrictive. Except where
explicitly prohibited in the BDS for specific items or standards, 
the Bidder may substitute alternative brand/model names or 
standards in its bid, provided that it demonstrates to the 
Purchaser’s satisfaction that the use of the substitute(s) will 
result in the Information System being able to perform 
substantially equivalent to or better than that specified in the 
Technical Requirements.
17. Securing the 
Bid
17.1 The BDS for this Clause specifies whether bids must be secured, 
and if so, whether by a Bid-Securing Declaration or by a Bid 
Security. If a Bid Security is required or optional, the BDS also 
specifies the amount.
17.2 Securing the bids shall be substantially in accordance with the 
related sample forms included in Section VII or other forms 
approved by the Purchaser prior to bid submission. Bids must 
remain secured for a period of 28 days beyond the validity 
period of the bids, as extended, if applicable, in accordance with 
ITB Clause 18.2. In case of a Bid Security, it shall also: 
(a) at the Bidder’s option, be in the form of either a certified 
check, letter of credit, or a bank guarantee from a banking 
institution, or a bond issued by a surety;
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 27
(b) be issued by a reputable institution selected by the Bidder 
and located in any eligible country; if the institution 
issuing the security is located outside the Purchaser’s 
Country, it shall have a correspondent financial institution 
located in the Purchaser’s Country to make the security 
enforceable;
(c) be payable promptly upon written demand by the 
Purchaser in case any of the conditions listed in ITB 
Clause 17.6 is/are invoked;
(d) be submitted in its original form; copies will not be 
accepted.
17.3 The Bid-Securing Declaration or the Bid Security of a Joint 
Venture shall be issued in the name of the Joint Venture 
submitting the bid provided the Joint Venture has legally been 
constituted, or else it shall be issued in the name of all partners 
proposed for the Joint Venture in the bid. Sanctions due to a 
breach of the terms of a Bid-Securing Declaration pursuant to 
ITB Clause 17.6 will apply to all partners to the Joint Venture.
17.4 If a Bid-Securing Declaration or Bid Security is required in 
accordance with ITB Clause 17.1, any bid not accompanied by a 
substantially acceptable Bid-Securing Declaration or Bid 
Security in accordance with ITB Clauses 17.2 and 17.3, shall be 
rejected by the Purchaser as non-responsive.
17.5 Unless executed or forfeited pursuant to ITB Clause 17.6, BidSecuring Declarations, if any, will expire for, or Bid Securities, 
if any, will be returned as promptly as possible to,
(a) all Bidders upon annulment of the bidding pursuant to ITB 
Clause 34;
(b) Bidders refusing a request to extend the period of validity 
of their bids pursuant to ITB Clause 18.2;
(c) the successful Bidder once it has signed the Contract 
Agreement and furnished a valid Performance Security as 
required;
(d) the unsuccessful Bidders at the same time as in (c), that is, 
when they are informed about the successful establishment 
of the contract with the successful Bidder.
28 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
17.6 The Bid-Securing Declaration, if any, may be executed, or the 
Bid Security, if any, may be forfeited:
(a) if a Bidder withdraws its bid during the period of bid 
validity specified by the Bidder on the Bid Submission 
Form or any extension of validity the Bidder has agreed to 
pursuant to ITB Clause 18.2; or
(b) in the case of the successful Bidder, if the Bidder fails to:
(i) sign the Contract Agreement in accordance with ITB 
Clause 36; or
(ii) furnish the Performance Security in accordance with ITB Clause 
37.
17.7 If a bid security is not required in the BDS, and
(a) if a Bidder withdraws its bid during the period of bid 
validity specified by the Bidder on the Letter of Bid Form, 
except as provided in ITB 18.2, or
(b) if the successful Bidder fails to: sign the Contract in 
accordance with ITB 36; or furnish a performance security 
in accordance with ITB 37;
the Borrower may, if provided for in the BDS, declare the 
Bidder disqualified to be awarded a contract by the Employer 
for a period of time as stated in the BDS.
18. Period of 
Validity of 
Bids
18.1 Bids shall remain valid, at a minimum, for the period specified 
in the BDS after the deadline date for bid submission prescribed 
by the Purchaser, pursuant to ITB Clause 21. A bid valid for a 
shorter period shall be rejected by the Purchaser as nonresponsive. For the convenience of Bidders, the BDS spells out 
the minimal original expiration dates for the validity of the bid 
and, if applicable pursuant to ITB Clause 17.1, for securing the 
bid. However, Bidders are responsible for adjusting the dates in 
the BDS in accordance with any extensions to the deadline date 
of bid submission pursuant to ITB Clause 21.2. 
18.2 In exceptional circumstances, prior to expiry of the bid validity 
period, the Purchaser may request that the Bidders extend the 
period of validity for a specified additional period. The request 
and the responses to the request shall be made in writing. A 
Bidder may refuse the request without risking execution of the 
Bid-Securing Declaration or forfeiting the Bid Security, but in 
this case the bid will be out of the competition for the award. 
Except as provided in ITB Clause 18.3, a Bidder agreeing to the 
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 29
request will not be required or permitted to modify its bid, but 
will be required to ensure that the bid remains secured for a 
correspondingly longer period, pursuant to ITB Clause 17.2.
18.3 In the case of fixed price contracts, if the award is delayed by a 
period exceeding fifty-six (56) days beyond the expiry of the 
initial bid validity, the contract price will be adjusted as 
specified in the request for extension. Bid evaluation will be 
based on the bid prices without taking into consideration the 
above correction.
19. Format and 
Signing of Bid
19.1 The Bidder shall prepare an original and the number of 
copies/sets of the bid specified in the BDS, clearly marking 
each one as “ORIGINAL BID,” “COPY NO. 1,” “COPY 
NO. 2,” etc., as appropriate. In the event of any discrepancy 
between them, the original shall govern.
19.2 The original and all copies of the bid, each consisting of the 
documents listed in ITB Clause 13.1, shall be typed or written in 
indelible ink and shall be signed by a person or persons duly 
authorized to sign on behalf of the Bidder. The authorization 
must be in writing and included in the bid pursuant to ITB 
Clause 13.1 (d). The name and position held by each person 
signing the authorization must be typed or printed below the 
signature. All pages of the bid, except for unamended printed 
literature, shall be initialed by the person or persons signing the 
bid.
19.3 The bid shall contain no interlineations, erasures, or overwriting, 
except to correct errors made by the Bidder, in which case such 
corrections shall be initialed by the person or persons signing the 
bid.
19.4 The Bidder shall furnish in the Bid Submission Form (a sample 
of which is provided in the Sample Forms Section of the 
Bidding Documents) information regarding commissions or 
gratuities, if any, paid or to be paid to agents relating to this 
procurement and to the execution of the Contract should the 
Bidder be successful.
D. SUBMISSION OF BIDS
20. Sealing and 
Marking of 
Bids
20.1 The Bidder shall seal the original and each copy of the bid in 
separate envelopes, duly marking the envelopes as “ORIGINAL 
BID” and “COPY NO. [number].” The envelopes shall then be 
sealed in an outer envelope.
30 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
20.2 The inner and outer envelopes shall
(a) be addressed to the Purchaser at the address given in the 
BDS, and

Clause 1.2, and the statement “DO NOT OPEN BEFORE 
[ time and date],” to be completed with the time and date 
specified in the BDS for ITB Clause 24.1.
20.3 The inner envelopes shall also indicate the name and address of 
the Bidder so that the bid can be returned unopened in case it is 
declared “late.”
20.4 If the outer envelope is not sealed and marked as required by 
ITB Clause 20.2 above, the Purchaser will assume no 
responsibility for the bid’s misplacement or premature opening. 
If the outer envelope discloses the Bidder’s identity, the 
Purchaser will not guarantee the anonymity of the bid 
submission, but this disclosure will not constitute grounds for 
bid rejection.
21. Deadline for 
Submission of 
Bids
21.1 Bids must be received by the Purchaser at the address specified 
in the BDS for ITB Clause 20.2 no later than the time and date 
stated in the BDS.
21.2 The Purchaser may, at its discretion, extend this deadline for 
submission of bids by amending the Bidding Documents in 
accordance with ITB Clause 11.3, in which case all rights and 
obligations of the Purchaser and Bidders will thereafter be 
subject to the deadline as extended.
22. Late Bids 22.1 Any bid received by the Purchaser after the bid submission 
deadline prescribed by the Purchaser in the BDS for ITB Clause 
21, will be rejected and returned unopened to the Bidder.
23. Withdrawal, 
Substitution, 
and 
Modification of 
Bids
23.1 The Bidder may withdraw, substitute, or modify its bid after 
submission, provided that written notice of the withdrawal, 
substitution, or modification is received by the Purchaser prior to 
the deadline prescribed for bid submission. All notices must be 
duly signed by an authorized representative and shall include a 
copy of the authorization (the power of attorney) in accordance 
with ITB Sub-Clause 19.2. 
23.2 All notices of withdrawal, substitution, or modification shall
(a) be addressed to the Purchaser at the address named in the 
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 31
BDS for ITB Clause 20.2 (a), and
(b) bear the Contract name, the IFB Title and IFB Number, 
and the words “BID WITHDRAWAL NOTICE”, BID 
SUBSTITUTION NOTICE”, or “BID MODIFICATION NOTICE”. 
23.3 A notice may also be sent by electronic means such as fax or email, but in this case must include a scan of the mailing receipt 
showing both the sender's and receiver's addresses for the signed 
hardcopy of the notice, and a scan of the power of attorney.
23.4 Bids requested to be withdrawn in accordance with ITB 23.1 
shall be returned unopened to the Bidders. Bid withdrawal 
notices received after the bid submission deadline will be 
ignored, and the submitted bid will be deemed to be a validly 
submitted bid.
23.5 The substitution or modification of the bid shall be prepared, 
sealed, marked, and dispatched as follows:
(a) The Bidders shall provide an original and the number of 
copies specified in the BDS for ITB Clause 19.1 of any 
substitution or modification to its bid, clearly identified as 
such, in two inner envelopes duly marked “BID 
SUBSTITUTION -- ORIGINAL” or “BID MODIFICATION --
ORIGINAL” and “BID SUBSTITUTION -- COPIES” or “BID 
MODIFICATION -- COPIES.” The inner envelopes shall be 
sealed in an outer envelope, which shall be duly marked 
“BID SUBSTITUTION” or “BID MODIFICATION”.
(b) Other provisions concerning the marking and dispatch of a 
bid substitution or modification shall be in accordance with 
ITB Clauses 20.2, 20.3, and 20.4.
23.6 No bid may be withdrawn, substituted, or modified in the 
interval between the bid submission deadline and the expiration 
of the bid validity period specified by the Bidder in the Bid 
Submission Form, or any extension thereof agreed to by the 
Bidder. Withdrawal of a bid during this interval may result in 
the execution of the Bid-Securing Declaration, if any, or 
forfeiture of the Bid Security, if any, pursuant to ITB Clause 
17.6.
E. BID OPENING AND EVALUATION
24. Opening of 
Bids by 
Purchaser
24.1 The Purchaser will open all bids, including withdrawals, 
substitutions, and modifications, in public, in the presence of 
Bidders’ representatives who choose to attend, at the time, on 
32 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
the date and at the place specified in the BDS. Bidders’ 
representatives shall sign a register as proof of their attendance.
24.2 First, envelopes marked “BID WITHDRAWAL NOTICE” shall be 
opened and read out and the envelope with the corresponding 
bid shall not be opened, but returned to the Bidder. No bid 
withdrawal shall be permitted unless the corresponding 
withdrawal notice contains a valid authorization to request the 
withdrawal and is read out at bid opening. Next, envelopes 
marked “BID SUBSTITUTION NOTICE” shall be opened and read 
out and exchanged with the corresponding bid being substituted, 
and the substituted bid shall not be opened, but returned to the 
Bidder. No bid substitution shall be permitted unless the 
corresponding substitution notice contains a valid authorization 
to request the substitution and is read out at bid opening. 
Envelopes marked “BID MODIFICATION NOTICE” shall be opened 
and read out with the corresponding bid. No bid modification 
shall be permitted unless the corresponding modification notice 
contains a valid authorization to request the modification and is 
read out at bid opening. Only bids that are opened and read out 
at bid opening shall be considered further.
24.3 Bids shall be opened one at a time, reading out: the name of the 
Bidder and whether there is a modification; the total bid price
including any unconditional discounts, and, if applicable, the 
prices and unconditional discounts for Subsystems, lots, or 
slices; the presence or absence of a Bid-Securing Declaration or 
a Bid Security if one was required; any conditional discounts 
offered for the award of more than one Subsystem, lot, or slice, 
if the BDS for ITB Clause 28.1 permits such discounts to be 
considered in the bid evaluation; and any other such details as 
the Purchaser may consider appropriate. 
24.4 Bids and modifications that are not opened and read out at bid 
opening shall not be considered for further evaluation, 
irrespective of the circumstances. These bids, including any 
bids validly withdrawn in accordance with ITB Clause 24.2, will 
promptly be returned, unopened, to their Bidders.
24.5 The Purchaser will prepare minutes of the bid opening, 
including the information disclosed to those present in 
accordance with ITB Clause 24.3. The minutes will promptly be 
distributed to all Bidders that met the deadline for submitting 
bids.
25. Clarification of 
Bids
25.1 During the bid evaluation, the Purchaser may, at its discretion, 
ask the Bidder for a clarification of its bid. The request for 
clarification and the response shall be in writing, and no change 
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 33
in the price or substance of the bid shall be sought, offered, or 
permitted.
26. Preliminary 
Examination 
of Bids
26.1 The Purchaser will examine the bids to determine whether they 
are complete, whether any computational errors have been 
made, whether required sureties have been furnished, whether 
the documents have been properly signed, and whether the bids 
are generally in order. In the case where a prequalification 
process has been undertaken for the Contract(s) for which these 
Bidding Documents have been issued, the Purchaser will ensure 
that each bid is from a prequalified Bidder, and in the case of a 
Joint Venture, that partners and structure of the Joint Venture 
are unchanged from those in the prequalification.
26.2 Arithmetical errors will be rectified on the following basis. If 
there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price, 
which is obtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, or 
between added or subtracted subtotals and totals, the unit or 
subtotal price shall prevail and the total price shall be corrected, 
unless in the opinion of the Purchaser there is an obvious 
misplacement of the decimal point in the unit or subtotal prices, 
in which case the line item total as quoted shall govern and the 
unit price or sub-total shall be corrected. If there is a 
discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words 
will prevail, unless the discrepancy is the result of a typo/error 
for which the correction is self-evident to the Purchaser. If the 
Bidder with the Lowest Evaluated Bid does not accept the 
correction of errors, the bid shall be rejected.
26.3 The Purchaser may waive any minor informality, 
nonconformity, or irregularity in a bid that does not constitute a 
material deviation, provided such waiver does not prejudice or 
affect the relative ranking of any Bidder.
26.4 Prior to the detailed evaluation, the Purchaser will determine 
whether each bid is of acceptable quality, is complete, and is 
substantially responsive to the Bidding Documents. For 
purposes of this determination, a substantially responsive bid is 
one that conforms to all the terms, conditions, and specifications 
of the Bidding Documents without material deviations, 
exceptions, objections, conditionalities, or reservations. A 
material deviation, exception, objection, conditionality, or 
reservation is one: (i) that limits in any substantial way the 
scope, quality, or performance of the Information System; or 
(ii) that limits, in any substantial way that is inconsistent with 
the Bidding Documents, the Purchaser’s rights or the successful 
Bidder’s obligations under the Contract; or (iii) the acceptance 
34 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
of which would unfairly affect the competitive position of other 
Bidders who have submitted substantially responsive bids.
26.5 If a bid is not substantially responsive, it will be rejected by the 
Purchaser and may not subsequently be made responsive by the 
Bidder by correction of the nonconformity. The Purchaser’s 
determination of bid responsiveness will be based on the 
contents of the bid itself. 
27. Conversion to 
Single 
Currency
27.1 For evaluation and comparison purposes, the Purchaser shall 
convert all bid prices expressed in various currencies and 
amounts into a single currency specified in the BDS, using the 
selling exchange rate established by the source and on the date 
also specified in the BDS.
28. Evaluation and 
Comparison of 
Bids
28.1 The Purchaser will evaluate and compare the bids that have been 
determined to be substantially responsive, pursuant to ITB 
Clause 26. The evaluation will be performed assuming either 
that:
(a) the Contract will be awarded to the lowest evaluated 
Bidder for the entire Information System; or
(b) if specified in the BDS, Contracts will be awarded to the 
Bidders for each individual Subsystem, lot, or slice defined 
in the Technical Requirements whose bids result in the 
lowest combined evaluated price for the entire System.
In the latter case, discounts that are conditional on the award of 
more than one Subsystem, lot, or slice may be offered in bids. 
However, such discounts will only be considered in the price 
evaluation if so confirmed in the BDS.
28.2 To be considered for Contract award, Bidders must have 
submitted bids
(a) for which detailed bid evaluation using the same standards 
for compliance determination as listed in ITB Clauses 26.3 
and 26.4 confirms that the bids are commercially and 
technically responsive, and include the hardware, 
Software, related equipment, products, Materials, and 
other Goods and Services components of the Information 
System in, substantially, the full required quantities for the 
entire Information System or, if allowed in the BDS for 
ITB Clause 28.1, the individual Subsystem, lot or slice bid 
on; and
(b) that offer Information Technologies that are proven to 
perform up to the standards promised in the bid by having
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 35
successfully passed the performance, benchmark, and/or 
functionality tests the Purchaser may require, pursuant to 
ITB Clause 31.2.
28.3 The Purchaser’s evaluation of a bid will be made on the basis of 
prices quoted in accordance with ITB Clause 14 (Bid Prices). 
28.4 If indicated by the BDS, the Purchaser’s evaluation of 
responsive bids will take into account technical factors, in 
addition to cost factors. An Evaluated Bid Score (B) will be 
calculated for each responsive bid using the following formula, 
which permits a comprehensive assessment of the bid price and 
the technical merits of each bid: 
where
C = Evaluated Bid Price
C low = the lowest of all Evaluated Bid Prices among 
responsive bids
T = the total Technical Score awarded to the bid
Thigh = the Technical Score achieved by the bid that was 
scored highest among all responsive bids
X = weight for the Price as specified in the BDS
The bid with the highest Evaluated Bid Score (B) among 
responsive bids shall be termed the Lowest Evaluated Bid and is 
eligible for Contract award, provided the Bidder was 
prequalified and/or it was found to be qualified to perform the 
Contract in accordance with ITB Clause 31 (Postqualification).
28.5 If, in addition to the cost factors, the Purchaser has chosen to 
give weight to important technical factors (i.e., the price weight, 
X, is less than 1 in the evaluation), that cannot be reduced to 
life-cycle costs or pass/fail criteria, the Total Technical Points 
assigned to each bid in the Evaluated Bid Formula will be 
determined by adding and weighting the scores assigned by an 
evaluation committee to technical features of the bid in 
accordance with the criteria set forth below.
(a) The technical features to be evaluated are generally 
defined below and specifically identified in the BDS:
(i) Performance, capacity, or functionality features that

36 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
either exceed levels specified as mandatory in the 
Technical Requirements; and/or influence the lifecycle cost and effectiveness of the Information 
System.
(ii) Usability features, such as ease of use, ease of 
administration, or ease of expansion, which 
influence the life-cycle cost and effectiveness of the 
Information System. 
(iii) The quality of the Bidder’s Preliminary Project Plan 
as evidenced by the thoroughness, reasonableness, 
and responsiveness of: (a) the task and resource 
schedules, both general and specific, and (b) the 
proposed arrangements for management and 
coordination, training, quality assurance, technical 
support, logistics, problem resolution, and transfer of 
knowledge, and other such activities as specified by 
the Purchaser in Section VI (Technical 
Requirements) or proposed by the Bidder based on 
the Bidder’s experience.
(b) Feature scores will be grouped into a small number of 
evaluation categories, generally defined below and 
specifically identified in the BDS, namely:
(i) The technical features that reflect how well the 
Information System meets the Purchaser’s Business 
Requirements (including quality assurance and riskcontainment measures associated with the 
implementation of the Information System).
(ii) The technical features that reflect how well the 
Information System meets the System’s Functional 
Performance Standards.
(iii) The technical features that reflect how well the 
Information System meets the General Technical 
Requirements for hardware, network and 
communications, Software, and Services.
(c) As specified in the BDS, each category will be given a 
weight and within each category each feature may also be 
given a weight.
(d) During the evaluation process, the evaluation committee 
will assign each desirable/preferred feature a whole 
number score from 0 to 4, where 0 means that the feature 
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 37
is absent, and 1 to 4 either represent predefined values for 
desirable features amenable to an objective way of rating 
(as is the case for, e.g., extra memory, or extra mass 
storage capacity, etc., if these extras would be conducive 
for the utility of the system), or if the feature represents a 
desirable functionality (e.g., of a software package) or a 
quality improving the prospects for a successful 
implementation (such as the strengths of the proposed 
project staff, the methodology, the elaboration of the 
project plan, etc., in the bid), the scoring will be 1 for the 
feature being present but showing deficiencies; 2 for 
meeting the requirements; 3 for marginally exceeding the 
requirements; and 4 for significantly exceeding the 
requirements.
(e) The score for each feature (i) within a category (j) will be 
combined with the scores of features in the same category 
as a weighted sum to form the Category Technical Score 
using the following formula: 
where:
tji = the technical score for feature “i” in category “j”
wji = the weight of feature “i” in category “j”
k = the number of scored features in category “j”
and 
(f) The Category Technical Scores will be combined in a 
weighted sum to form the total Technical Bid Score using 
the following formula:
where:
Sj = the Category Technical Score of category “j”
Wj = the weight of category “j” as specified in the BDS
n = the number of categories

38 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
and 
28.6 The Evaluated Bid Price (C) for each responsive bid will be 
determined as the sum of the Adjusted Supply and Installation 
Costs (P) plus the Recurrent Costs (R);
where the Adjusted Supply and Installation Costs (P) are 
determined as:
(a) The price of the hardware, Software, related equipment, 
products, Materials and other Goods offered from within 
or from outside the Purchaser’s Country, in accordance 
with ITB 14.4; plus
(b) The total price for all software development, 
transportation, insurance, installation, customization, 
integration, Commissioning, testing, training, technical 
support, repair, and other Services, in accordance with ITB 
14.5;
(c) with adjustments for:
(i) Deviations proposed to the Implementation Schedule 
in the Technical Requirements resulting in delayed 
completion of the entire Information System, if 
permitted in the BDS and provided they do not 
exceed the maximum permissible delay period 
specified in the BDS. For evaluation purposes, a pro 
rata increase of the total Supply and Installation 
Costs will be added using the percentage(s) specified 
in the BDS for each week of delay. Bids offering 
deliveries beyond the maximum permissible delay 
specified may be rejected.
(ii) Deviations taken to the Contract payment schedule 
specified in the SCC. If deviations are permitted in 
the BDS, for evaluation purposes the total Supply 
and Installation Costs will be increased pro rata by 
the amount of interest that could otherwise be earned 
on the amount of any payments that would fall due 
under the proposed schedule earlier than the schedule 
stipulated in the SCC, at the interest rate specified in 
the BDS.
(iii) Goods and Services that are required for the 
Information System but have been left out or are 
necessary to correct minor deviations of the bid will

Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 39
be added to the total Supply and Installation Costs 
using costs taken from the highest prices from other 
responsive bids for the same Goods and Services, or 
in the absence of such information, the cost will be 
estimated at prevailing list prices. If the missing 
Goods and Services are a scored technical feature, 
the relevant score will be set at zero. 
(iv) Corrections to errors in arithmetic, in accordance 
with ITB Clause 26.2.
(v) Any discounts offered for the award of more than 
one Subsystem, lot, or slice, if the BDS for ITB 
Clause 28.1 permits the consideration of discounts in 
the price evaluation.
(d) The Recurrent Costs (R) are reduced to net present value 
and determined using the following formula: 
where
N = number of years of the Warranty Period, defined in 
SCC Clause 29.4
M = number of years of the Post-Warranty Services 
Period, as defined in SCC Clause 1.1.(e) (xii) 
x = an index number 1, 2, 3, ... N + M representing 
each year of the combined Warranty Service and 
Post-Warranty Service Periods.
Rx = total Recurrent Costs for year “x,” as recorded in 
the Recurrent Cost Sub-Table.
I = discount rate to be used for the Net Present Value 
calculation, as specified in the BDS.
29. Domestic 
Preference
29.1 No margin of domestic preference will apply.
30. Contacting the 
Purchaser
30.1 From the time of bid opening to the time of Contract award, if 
any Bidder wishes to contact the Purchaser on any matter related 
to the bid, it should do so in writing.
30.2 If a Bidder tries to directly influence the Purchaser or otherwise 
interfere in the bid evaluation process and the Contract award 
decision, its bid may be rejected.

F. POSTQUALIFICATION AND AWARD OF CONTRACT
31. Postqualification
31.1 The Purchaser will determine at its own cost and to its 
satisfaction whether the Bidder (including Joint Venture 
Partners, and any Subcontractors for which the BDS for ITB 
Clause 6.1 (a) permits that their qualifications count towards the 
required Bidder qualifications) that is selected as having 
submitted the Lowest Evaluated Bid is qualified to perform the 
Contract satisfactorily, in accordance with ITB Clause 6. If a 
prequalification process was undertaken for the Contract(s) for 
which these Bidding Documents were issued, the Purchaser will 
determine in the manner described above that no material 
changes have occurred after the prequalification that negatively 
affect the ability of the Bidder that has submitted the Lowest 
Evaluated Bid to perform the Contract.
31.2 Pursuant to ITB Clauses 6 and 16, and as additionally may be 
specified in the BDS, the determination will evaluate the 
Bidder’s financial, technical, design, integration, customization, 
production, management, and support capabilities and will be 
based on an examination of the documentary evidence of the 
Bidder’s qualifications, as well as other information the 
Purchaser deems necessary and appropriate. This determination 
may include visits or interviews with the Bidder’s clients 
referenced in its bid, site inspections, and any other measures. If 
so specified in the BDS, at the time of postqualification the 
Purchaser may also carry out tests to determine that the 
performance or functionality of the Information System offered 
meets those stated in the Technical Requirements.
31.3 An affirmative postqualification determination will be a 
prerequisite for award of the Contract to the Lowest Evaluated 
Bidder. A negative determination will result in rejection of the 
Bidder’s bid, in which event the Purchaser will proceed to the 
next lowest evaluated Bidder to make a similar determination of 
that Bidder’s capabilities to perform satisfactorily.
32. Award 
Criteria
32.1 Subject to ITB Clause 34, the Purchaser will award the Contract 
to the Bidder whose bid has been determined to be substantially 
responsive and the Lowest Evaluated Bid, provided further that 
the Bidder has been determined to be qualified to perform the 
Contract satisfactorily, pursuant to ITB Clause 31.
33. Purchaser’s 
Right to Vary 
Quantities at 
Time of Award
33.1 The Purchaser reserves the right at the time of Contract award to 
increase or decrease, by the percentage(s) indicated in the BDS,
any of the following:
Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB) 41
(a) the quantity of substantially identical Subsystems; or
(b) the quantity of individual hardware, Software, related 
equipment, Materials, products, and other Goods 
components of the Information System; or
(c) the quantity of Installation or other Services to be 
performed,
from that originally specified in the Technical Requirements (as 
amended by any Addenda issued pursuant to ITB Clause 11), 
without any change in unit prices or other terms and conditions.
34. Purchaser’s 
Right to 
Accept Any 
Bid and to 
Reject Any or 
All Bids
34.1 The Purchaser reserves the right to accept or reject any bid or to 
annul the bidding process and reject all bids at any time prior to 
Contract award, without thereby incurring any liability to the 
Bidders.
35. Notification of 
Award
35.1 Prior to the expiration of the period of bid validity, the Purchaser 
shall notify the successful Bidder, in writing, that its bid has 
been accepted.
35.2 Until a formal Contract is prepared and executed, the 
notification of award shall constitute a binding Contract.
35.3 The Purchaser shall promptly publish in UNDB online and in 
dgMarket the results, identifying the bid and lot numbers and the 
following information: (i) name of each Bidder who submitted a 
bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening; (iii) name, 
evaluated price and, if the bidding conditions included scoring 
for technical quality, the technical score of each bid that was 
evaluated; (iv) name of Bidders whose bids were rejected and 
the reasons for their rejection; and (v) name of the winning 
Bidder, the price it offered, as well as the duration and summary 
scope of the contract awarded. After publication of the award, 
unsuccessful Bidders may make a request in writing to the 
Purchaser for a debriefing seeking explanations on the grounds 
on which their bids were not selected. The Purchaser shall 
promptly respond in writing to any unsuccessful Bidder who, 
after publication of contract award, requests a debriefing.
35.4 Upon the successful Bidder furnishing the signed Contract 
Agreement and the Performance Security pursuant to ITB 
Clause 37, the Purchaser will promptly notify each unsuccessful 
Bidder, and will discharge all remaining Bid Securities, if any, 
as provided in ITB Clause 17.5 (c) and (d).
42 Section I. Instructions to Bidders (ITB)
36. Signing of 
Contract
36.1 At the same time as the Purchaser notifies the successful Bidder 
that its bid has been accepted, the Purchaser will send the Bidder 
the Contract Agreement provided in the Bidding Documents, 
incorporating all agreements between the parties.
36.2 As soon as practically possible, but no more than twenty-eight 
(28) days following receipt of the Contract Agreement, the 
successful Bidder shall sign and date it, and return it to the 
Purchaser.
37. Performance 
Security
37.1 As soon as practically possible, but no more than twenty-eight 
(28) days following receipt of notification of award from the 
Purchaser, the successful Bidder shall furnish the Performance 
Security in accordance with the GCC, using the Performance 
Security form provided in the Bidding Documents or another 
form acceptable to the Purchaser.
37.2 Failure of the successful Bidder to comply with the requirements 
of ITB Clause 36 or ITB Clause 37.1 shall constitute sufficient 
grounds for the annulment of the award and, if and as 
applicable, execution of the Bid-Securing Declaration or 
forfeiture of the Bid Security, in which event the Purchaser may 
make the award to the next lowest evaluated bid submitted by a 
qualified Bidder or call for new bids.
38. Adjudicator 38.1 Unless otherwise stated in the BDS, the Purchaser proposes that 
the person named in the BDS be appointed as Adjudicator under 
the Contract to assume the role of informal Contract dispute 
mediator, as described in GCC Clause 6. In this case, a résumé 
of the named person is attached to the BDS. The proposed 
hourly fee for the Adjudicator is specified in the BDS. The 
expenses that would be considered reimbursable to the 
Adjudicator are also specified in the BDS. If a Bidder does not 
accept the Adjudicator proposed by the Purchaser, it should state 
its non-acceptance in its Bid Submission Form and make a 
counterproposal of an Adjudicator and an hourly fee, attaching a 
résumé of the alternative. If the successful Bidder and the 
Adjudicator nominated in the BDS happen to be from the same 
country, and this is not the country of the Purchaser too, the 
Purchaser reserves the right to cancel the Adjudicator nominated 
in the BDS and propose a new one. If by the day the Contract is 
signed, the Purchaser and the successful Bidder have not agreed 
on the appointment of the Adjudicator, the Adjudicator shall be 
appointed, at the request of either party, by the Appointing 
Authority specified in the SCC clause relating to GCC Clause 
6.1.4, or if no Appointing Authority is specified there, the 
Contract will be implemented without an Adjudicator.

period set forth in the Contract, the Purchaser shall pay to the 
Supplier interest on the amount of such delayed payment at 
the rate(s) specified in the SCC for the period of delay until 
payment has been made in full, whether before or after 
judgment or arbitration award.
12.4 All payments shall be made in the currency(ies) specified in 
the Contract Agreement, pursuant to GCC Clause 11. For 
Goods and Services supplied locally, payments shall be 
made in the currency of the Purchaser’s Country, unless 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 79
otherwise specified in the SCC.
12.5 Unless otherwise specified in the SCC, payment of the 
foreign currency portion of the Contract Price for Goods 
supplied from outside the Purchaser’s Country shall be made 
to the Supplier through an irrevocable letter of credit opened 
by an authorized bank in the Supplier’s Country and will be 
payable on presentation of the appropriate documents. It is 
agreed that the letter of credit will be subject to Article 10 of 
the latest revision of Uniform Customs and Practice for 
Documentary Credits, published by the International 
Chamber of Commerce, Paris.
13. Securities 13.1 Issuance of Securities
The Supplier shall provide the securities specified below in 
favor of the Purchaser at the times and in the amount, 
manner, and form specified below.
13.2 Advance Payment Security
13.2.1As specified in the SCC, the Supplier shall provide a 
security equal in amount and currency to the advance 
payment, and valid until the System is Operationally 
Accepted.
13.2.2The security shall be in the form provided in the 
Bidding Documents or in another form acceptable to 
the Purchaser. The amount of the security shall be 
reduced in proportion to the value of the System 
executed by and paid to the Supplier from time to time 
and shall automatically become null and void when 
the full amount of the advance payment has been 
recovered by the Purchaser. The way the value of the 
security is deemed to become reduced and, eventually, 
voided is as specified in the SCC. The security shall 
be returned to the Supplier immediately after its 
expiration. 
13.3 Performance Security
13.3.1The Supplier shall, within twenty-eight (28) days of 
the notification of Contract award, provide a security 
for the due performance of the Contract in the amount 
and currency specified in the SCC.
13.3.2The security shall be a bank guarantee in the form 
provided in the Sample Forms Section of the Bidding 
Documents, or it shall be in another form acceptable 
80 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
to the Purchaser.
13.3.3The security shall automatically become null and void 
once all the obligations of the Supplier under the 
Contract have been fulfilled, including, but not limited 
to, any obligations during the Warranty Period and 
any extensions to the period. The security shall be 
returned to the Supplier no later than twenty-eight (28) 
days after its expiration.
13.3.4Upon Operational Acceptance of the entire System, 
the security shall be reduced to the amount specified 
in the SCC, on the date of such Operational 
Acceptance, so that the reduced security would only 
cover the remaining warranty obligations of the 
Supplier.
14. Taxes and Duties 14.1 For Goods or Services supplied from outside the Purchaser’s 
country, the Supplier shall be entirely responsible for all 
taxes, stamp duties, license fees, and other such levies 
imposed outside the Purchaser’s country. Any duties, such 
as importation or customs duties, and taxes and other levies, 
payable in the Purchaser’s country for the supply of Goods 
and Services from outside the Purchaser’s country are the 
responsibility of the Purchaser unless these duties or taxes 
have been made part of the Contract Price in Article 2 of the 
Contract Agreement and the Price Schedule it refers to, in 
which case the duties and taxes will be the Supplier’s 
responsibility.
14.2 For Goods or Services supplied locally, the Supplier shall be 
entirely responsible for all taxes, duties, license fees, etc., 
incurred until delivery of the contracted Goods or Services to 
the Purchaser. The only exception are taxes or duties, such 
as value-added or sales tax or stamp duty as apply to, or are 
clearly identifiable, on the invoices and provided they apply 
in the Purchaser’s country, and only if these taxes, levies 
and/or duties are also excluded from the Contract Price in 
Article 2 of the Contract Agreement and the Price Schedule 
it refers to.
14.3 If any tax exemptions, reductions, allowances, or privileges 
may be available to the Supplier in the Purchaser’s Country, 
the Purchaser shall use its best efforts to enable the Supplier 
to benefit from any such tax savings to the maximum 
allowable extent. 
14.4 For the purpose of the Contract, it is agreed that the Contract 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 81
Price specified in Article 2 (Contract Price and Terms of 
Payment) of the Contract Agreement is based on the taxes, 
duties, levies, and charges prevailing at the date twenty-eight 
(28) days prior to the date of bid submission in the 
Purchaser’s Country (also called “Tax” in this GCC Clause 
14.4). If any Tax rates are increased or decreased, a new Tax 
is introduced, an existing Tax is abolished, or any change in 
interpretation or application of any Tax occurs in the course 
of the performance of the Contract, which was or will be 
assessed on the Supplier, its Subcontractors, or their 
employees in connection with performance of the Contract, 
an equitable adjustment to the Contract Price shall be made 
to fully take into account any such change by addition to or 
reduction from the Contract Price, as the case may be.

15. Copyright 15.1 The Intellectual Property Rights in all Standard Software and 
Standard Materials shall remain vested in the owner of such 
rights.
15.2 The Purchaser agrees to restrict use, copying, or duplication 
of the Standard Software and Standard Materials in

Contract or on creation of the rights (if later than the date of 
this Contract), vest in the Purchaser. The Supplier shall do 
82 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
and execute or arrange for the doing and executing of each 
necessary act, document, and thing that the Purchaser may 
consider necessary or desirable to perfect the right, title, and 
interest of the Purchaser in and to those rights. In respect of 
such Custom Software and Custom Materials, the Supplier 
shall ensure that the holder of a moral right in such an item 
does not assert it, and the Supplier shall, if requested to do so 
by the Purchaser and where permitted by applicable law, 
ensure that the holder of such a moral right waives it. 
15.5 The parties shall enter into such (if any) escrow 
arrangements in relation to the Source Code to some or all of 
the Software as are specified in the SCC and in accordance 
with the SCC.

period when use is being transferred between 
primary and backup;
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 83
(ii) as specified in the SCC, used or copied for use 
on or transferred to a replacement computer(s), 
(and use on the original and replacement 
computer(s) may be simultaneous during a 
reasonable transitional period) provided that, if 
the Technical Requirements and/or the Supplier’s 
bid specifies a class of computer to which the 
license is restricted and unless the Supplier agrees 
otherwise in writing, the replacement computer(s) 
is(are) within that class;
(iii) if the nature of the System is such as to permit 
such access, accessed from other computers 
connected to the primary and/or backup 
computer(s) by means of a local or wide-area 
network or similar arrangement, and used on or 
copied for use on those other computers to the 
extent necessary to that access;
(iv) reproduced for safekeeping or backup purposes;

any substantial part of the delivered, restricted 
Software shall be subject to same restrictions as 
are set forth in this Contract;
(vi) as specified in the SCC, disclosed to, and 
reproduced for use by, support service suppliers 
and their subcontractors, (and the Purchaser may 
sublicense such persons to use and copy for use 
the Software) to the extent reasonably necessary 
to the performance of their support service 
contracts, subject to the same restrictions as are 
set forth in this Contract; and
(vii) disclosed to, and reproduced for use by, the 
Purchaser and by such other persons as are 
specified in the SCC (and the Purchaser may 
sublicense such persons to use and copy for use 
the Software), subject to the same restrictions as 
are set forth in this Contract.
16.2 The Standard Software may be subject to audit by the 
Supplier, in accordance with the terms specified in the SCC,
to verify compliance with the above license agreements.
84 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract

Information
17.1 Except if otherwise specified in the SCC, the "Receiving 
Party" (either the Purchaser or the Supplier) shall keep 
confidential and shall not, without the written consent of the 
other party to this Contract (“the Disclosing Party”), divulge 
to any third party any documents, data, or other information 
of a confidential nature (“Confidential Information”) 
connected with this Contract, and furnished directly or 
indirectly by the Disclosing Party prior to or during 
performance, or following termination, of this Contract.
17.2 For the purposes of GCC Clause 17.1, the Supplier is also 
deemed to be the Receiving Party of Confidential 
Information generated by the Supplier itself in the course of 
the performance of its obligations under the Contract and 
relating to the businesses, finances, suppliers, employees, or 
other contacts of the Purchaser or the Purchaser’s use of the 
System.
17.3 Notwithstanding GCC Clauses 17.1 and 17.2:
(a) the Supplier may furnish to its Subcontractor 
Confidential Information of the Purchaser to the extent 
reasonably required for the Subcontractor to perform 
its work under the Contract; and
(b) the Purchaser may furnish Confidential Information of 
the Supplier: (i) to its support service suppliers and 
their subcontractors to the extent reasonably required 
for them to perform their work under their support 
service contracts; and (ii) to its affiliates and 
subsidiaries,
in which event the Receiving Party shall ensure that the 
person to whom it furnishes Confidential Information of the 
Disclosing Party is aware of and abides by the Receiving 
Party’s obligations under this GCC Clause 17 as if that 
person were party to the Contract in place of the Receiving 
Party.
17.4 The Purchaser shall not, without the Supplier’s prior written 
consent, use any Confidential Information received from the 
Supplier for any purpose other than the operation, 
maintenance and further development of the System. 
Similarly, the Supplier shall not, without the Purchaser’s 
prior written consent, use any Confidential Information 
received from the Purchaser for any purpose other than those 
that are required for the performance of the Contract. 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 85
17.5 The obligation of a party under GCC Clauses 17.1 through 
17.4 above, however, shall not apply to that information 
which:
(a) now or hereafter enters the public domain through no 
fault of the Receiving Party;
(b) can be proven to have been possessed by the Receiving 
Party at the time of disclosure and that was not 
previously obtained, directly or indirectly, from the 
Disclosing Party;
(c) otherwise lawfully becomes available to the Receiving 
Party from a third party that has no obligation of 
confidentiality.
17.6 The above provisions of this GCC Clause 17 shall not in any 
way modify any undertaking of confidentiality given by 
either of the parties to this Contract prior to the date of the 
Contract in respect of the System or any part thereof.
17.7 The provisions of this GCC Clause 17 shall survive the 
termination, for whatever reason, of the Contract for three 
(3) years or such longer period as may be specified in the 
SCC.
E. SUPPLY, INSTALLATION, TESTING,
COMMISSIONING, AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE SYSTEM
18. Representatives 18.1 Project Manager
If the Project Manager is not named in the Contract, then 
within fourteen (14) days of the Effective Date, the 
Purchaser shall appoint and notify the Supplier in writing of 
the name of the Project Manager. The Purchaser may from 
time to time appoint some other person as the Project 
Manager in place of the person previously so appointed and 
shall give a notice of the name of such other person to the 
Supplier without delay. No such appointment shall be made 
at such a time or in such a manner as to impede the progress 
of work on the System. Such appointment shall take effect 
only upon receipt of such notice by the Supplier. Subject to 
the extensions and/or limitations specified in the SCC (if 
any), the Project Manager shall have the authority to 
represent the Purchaser on all day-to-day matters relating to 
the System or arising from the Contract, and shall normally 
be the person giving or receiving notices on behalf of the 
86 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
Purchaser pursuant to GCC Clause 4.
18.2 Supplier’s Representative
18.2.1 If the Supplier’s Representative is not named in the 
Contract, then within fourteen (14) days of the 
Effective Date, the Supplier shall appoint the 
Supplier’s Representative and shall request the 
Purchaser in writing to approve the person so 
appointed. The request must be accompanied by a 
detailed curriculum vitae for the nominee, as well as a 
description of any other System or non-System 
responsibilities the nominee would retain while 
performing the duties of the Supplier’s Representative. 
If the Purchaser does not object to the appointment 
within fourteen (14) days, the Supplier’s 
Representative shall be deemed to have been 
approved. If the Purchaser objects to the appointment 
within fourteen (14) days giving the reason therefor, 
then the Supplier shall appoint a replacement within 
fourteen (14) days of such objection in accordance 
with this GCC Clause 18.2.1.
18.2.2Subject to the extensions and/or limitations specified 
in the SCC (if any), the Supplier’s Representative 
shall have the authority to represent the Supplier on all 
day-to-day matters relating to the System or arising 
from the Contract, and shall normally be the person 
giving or receiving notices on behalf of the Supplier 
pursuant to GCC Clause 4.
18.2.3The Supplier shall not revoke the appointment of the 
Supplier’s Representative without the Purchaser’s 
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably 
withheld. If the Purchaser consents to such an action, 
the Supplier shall appoint another person of equal or 
superior qualifications as the Supplier’s 
Representative, pursuant to the procedure set out in 
GCC Clause 18.2.1.
18.2.4The Supplier’s Representative and staff are obliged to 
work closely with the Purchaser’s Project Manager 
and staff, act within their own authority, and abide by 
directives issued by the Purchaser that are consistent 
with the terms of the Contract. The Supplier’s 
Representative is responsible for managing the 
activities of its personnel and any subcontracted 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 87
personnel.
18.2.5The Supplier’s Representative may, subject to the 
approval of the Purchaser (which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld), at any time delegate to any 
person any of the powers, functions, and authorities 
vested in him or her. Any such delegation may be 
revoked at any time. Any such delegation or 
revocation shall be subject to a prior notice signed by 
the Supplier’s Representative and shall specify the 
powers, functions, and authorities thereby delegated or 
revoked. No such delegation or revocation shall take 
effect unless and until the notice of it has been 
delivered. 
18.2.6Any act or exercise by any person of powers, 
functions and authorities so delegated to him or her in 
accordance with GCC Clause 18.2.5 shall be deemed 
to be an act or exercise by the Supplier’s 
Representative.
18.3 Objections and Removals
18.3.1The Purchaser may by notice to the Supplier object to 
any representative or person employed by the Supplier 
in the execution of the Contract who, in the reasonable 
opinion of the Purchaser, may have behaved 
inappropriately, be incompetent, or be negligent. The 
Purchaser shall provide evidence of the same, 
whereupon the Supplier shall remove such person 
from work on the System.
18.3.2 If any representative or person employed by the 
Supplier is removed in accordance with GCC Clause 
18.3.1, the Supplier shall, where required, promptly 
appoint a replacement.
19. Project Plan 19.1 In close cooperation with the Purchaser and based on the 
Preliminary Project Plan included in the Supplier’s bid, the

Project Plan in accordance with the procedure specified in 
the SCC. 
88 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
19.3 If required, the impact on the Implementation Schedule of 
modifications agreed during finalization of the Agreed and 
Finalized Project Plan shall be incorporated in the Contract 
by amendment, in accordance with GCC Clauses 39 and 40.
19.4 The Supplier shall undertake to supply, install, test, and 
commission the System in accordance with the Agreed and 
Finalized Project Plan and the Contract.
19.5 The Progress and other reports specified in the SCC shall be 
prepared by the Supplier and submitted to the Purchaser in 
the format and frequency specified in the Technical 
Requirements.
20. Subcontracting 20.1 Appendix 3 (List of Approved Subcontractors) to the 
Contract Agreement specifies critical items of supply or 
services and a list of Subcontractors for each item that are 
considered acceptable by the Purchaser. If no 
Subcontractors are listed for an item, the Supplier shall 
prepare a list of Subcontractors it considers qualified and 
wishes to be added to the list for such items. The Supplier 
may from time to time propose additions to or deletions from 
any such list. The Supplier shall submit any such list or any 
modification to the list to the Purchaser for its approval in 
sufficient time so as not to impede the progress of work on 
the System. The Purchaser shall not withhold such approval 
unreasonably. Such approval by the Purchaser of a 
Subcontractor(s) shall not relieve the Supplier from any of 
its obligations, duties, or responsibilities under the Contract.
20.2 The Supplier may, at its discretion, select and employ 
Subcontractors for such critical items from those 
Subcontractors listed pursuant to GCC Clause 20.1. If the 
Supplier wishes to employ a Subcontractor not so listed, or 
subcontract an item not so listed, it must seek the 
Purchaser’s prior approval under GCC Clause 20.3.
20.3 For items for which pre-approved Subcontractor lists have 
not been specified in Appendix 3 to the Contract Agreement, 
the Supplier may employ such Subcontractors as it may 
select, provided: (i) the Supplier notifies the Purchaser in 
writing at least twenty-eight (28) days prior to the proposed 
mobilization date for such Subcontractor; and (ii) by the end 
of this period either the Purchaser has granted its approval in 
writing or fails to respond. The Supplier shall not engage 
any Subcontractor to which the Purchaser has objected in 
writing prior to the end of the notice period. The absence of 
a written objection by the Purchaser during the above 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 89
specified period shall constitute formal acceptance of the 
proposed Subcontractor. Except to the extent that it permits 
the deemed approval of the Purchaser of Subcontractors not 
listed in the Contract Agreement, nothing in this Clause, 
however, shall limit the rights and obligations of either the 
Purchaser or Supplier as they are specified in GCC 
Clauses 20.1 and 20.2, in the SCC, or in Appendix 3 of the 
Contract Agreement.
21. Design and 
Engineering
21.1 Technical Specifications and Drawings
21.1.1The Supplier shall execute the basic and detailed 
design and the implementation activities necessary for 
successful installation of the System in compliance 
with the provisions of the Contract or, where not so 
specified, in accordance with good industry practice.
The Supplier shall be responsible for any 
discrepancies, errors or omissions in the 
specifications, drawings, and other technical 
documents that it has prepared, whether such 
specifications, drawings, and other documents have 
been approved by the Project Manager or not, 
provided that such discrepancies, errors, or omissions 
are not because of inaccurate information furnished in 
writing to the Supplier by or on behalf of the 
Purchaser.
21.1.2The Supplier shall be entitled to disclaim 
responsibility for any design, data, drawing, 
specification, or other document, or any modification 
of such design, drawings, specification, or other 
documents provided or designated by or on behalf of 
the Purchaser, by giving a notice of such disclaimer to 
the Project Manager.
21.2 Codes and Standards
Wherever references are made in the Contract to codes and 
standards in accordance with which the Contract shall be 
executed, the edition or the revised version of such codes and 
standards current at the date twenty-eight (28) days prior to 
date of bid submission shall apply unless otherwise specified 
in the SCC. During Contract execution, any changes in 
such codes and standards shall be applied after approval by 
the Purchaser and shall be treated in accordance with GCC 
Clause 39.3.
90 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
21.3 Approval/Review of Technical Documents by the Project 
Manager
21.3.1The Supplier shall prepare and furnish to the Project 
Manager the documents as specified in the SCC for 
the Project Manager’s approval or review.
Any part of the System covered by or related to the 
documents to be approved by the Project Manager 
shall be executed only after the Project Manager’s 
approval of these documents.
GCC Clauses 21.3.2 through 21.3.7 shall apply to 
those documents requiring the Project Manager’s 
approval, but not to those furnished to the Project 
Manager for its review only.
21.3.2Within fourteen (14) days after receipt by the Project 
Manager of any document requiring the Project 
Manager’s approval in accordance with GCC Clause 
21.3.1, the Project Manager shall either return one 
copy of the document to the Supplier with its approval 
endorsed on the document or shall notify the Supplier 
in writing of its disapproval of the document and the 
reasons for disapproval and the modifications that the 
Project Manager proposes. If the Project Manager fails 
to take such action within the fourteen (14) days, then 
the document shall be deemed to have been approved 
by the Project Manager.
21.3.3The Project Manager shall not disapprove any 
document except on the grounds that the document 
does not comply with some specified provision of the 
Contract or that it is contrary to good industry 
practice.
21.3.4 If the Project Manager disapproves the document, the 
Supplier shall modify the document and resubmit it 
for the Project Manager’s approval in accordance with 
GCC Clause 21.3.2. If the Project Manager approves 
the document subject to modification(s), the Supplier 
shall make the required modification(s), and the 
document shall then be deemed to have been 
approved, subject to GCC Clause 21.3.5. The 
procedure set out in GCC Clauses 21.3.2 through 
21.3.4 shall be repeated, as appropriate, until the 
Project Manager approves such documents.
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 91
21.3.5 If any dispute occurs between the Purchaser and the 
Supplier in connection with or arising out of the 
disapproval by the Project Manager of any document 
and/or any modification(s) to a document that cannot 
be settled between the parties within a reasonable 
period, then, in case the Contract Agreement includes 
and names an Adjudicator, such dispute may be 
referred to the Adjudicator for determination in 
accordance with GCC Clause 6.1 (Adjudicator). If 
such dispute is referred to an Adjudicator, the Project 
Manager shall give instructions as to whether and if 
so, how, performance of the Contract is to proceed. 
The Supplier shall proceed with the Contract in 
accordance with the Project Manager’s instructions, 
provided that if the Adjudicator upholds the Supplier’s 
view on the dispute and if the Purchaser has not given 
notice under GCC Clause 6.1.2, then the Supplier 
shall be reimbursed by the Purchaser for any 
additional costs incurred by reason of such 
instructions and shall be relieved of such 
responsibility or liability in connection with the 
dispute and the execution of the instructions as the 
Adjudicator shall decide, and the Time for Achieving 
Operational Acceptance shall be extended 
accordingly.
21.3.6The Project Manager’s approval, with or without 
modification of the document furnished by the 
Supplier, shall not relieve the Supplier of any 
responsibility or liability imposed upon it by any 
provisions of the Contract except to the extent that any 
subsequent failure results from modifications required 
by the Project Manager or inaccurate information 
furnished in writing to the Supplier by or on behalf of 
the Purchaser.
21.3.7The Supplier shall not depart from any approved 
document unless the Supplier has first submitted to 
the Project Manager an amended document and 
obtained the Project Manager’s approval of the 
document, pursuant to the provisions of this GCC 
Clause 21.3. If the Project Manager requests any 
change in any already approved document and/or in 
any document based on such an approved document, 
the provisions of GCC Clause 39 (Changes to the 
System) shall apply to such request.

be deemed to have been accepted as of the date of the 
Supplier’s said notice.
27.4 Partial Acceptance
27.4.1 If so specified in the SCC for GCC Clause 27.2.1, 
Installation and Commissioning shall be carried out 
individually for each identified major component or 
Subsystem(s) of the System. In this event, the 
provisions in the Contract relating to Installation and 
Commissioning, including the Operational Acceptance 
Test, shall apply to each such major component or 
Subsystem individually, and Operational Acceptance 
Certificate(s) shall be issued accordingly for each such 
major component or Subsystem of the System, subject to 
the limitations contained in GCC Clause 27.4.2.
27.4.2The issuance of Operational Acceptance Certificates for 
individual major components or Subsystems pursuant to 
GCC Clause 27.4.1 shall not relieve the Supplier of its 
obligation to obtain an Operational Acceptance 
Certificate for the System as an integrated whole (if so 
specified in the SCC for GCC Clauses 12.1 and 27.2.1) 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 101
once all major components and Subsystems have been

(b) any designs, specifications, or other data designed, 
supplied, or specified by or on behalf of the Purchaser or 
any matters for which the Supplier has disclaimed 
responsibility, in accordance with GCC Clause 21.1.2.
29.8 The Purchaser shall give the Supplier a notice promptly 
following the discovery of such defect, stating the nature of 
any such defect together with all available evidence. The 
Purchaser shall afford all reasonable opportunity for the 
104 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
Supplier to inspect any such defect. The Purchaser shall 
afford the Supplier all necessary access to the System and 
the site to enable the Supplier to perform its obligations

offer all possible assistance to the Purchaser to seek warranty 
services or remedial action from any subcontracted thirdparty producers or licensor of Goods included in the System, 
including without limitation assignment or transfer in favor 
of the Purchaser of the benefit of any warranties given by 
such producers or licensors to the Supplier. 
30. Functional 
Guarantees
30.1 The Supplier guarantees that, once the Operational 
Acceptance Certificate(s) has been issued, the System 
represents a complete, integrated solution to the Purchaser’s 
requirements set forth in the Technical Requirements and it 
conforms to all other aspects of the Contract. The Supplier 
acknowledges that GCC Clause 27 regarding 
Commissioning and Operational Acceptance governs how 
technical conformance of the System to the Contract 
requirements will be determined.
30.2 If, for reasons attributable to the Supplier, the System does 
not conform to the Technical Requirements or does not 
conform to all other aspects of the Contract, the Supplier 
shall at its cost and expense make such changes, 
modifications, and/or additions to the System as may be 
necessary to conform to the Technical Requirements and 
meet all functional and performance standards. The Supplier 
shall notify the Purchaser upon completion of the necessary

limitation, the Supplier shall secure all necessary written 
agreements, consents, and transfers of rights from its 
employees and other persons or entities whose services are 
used for development of the System.
32. Intellectual 
Property Rights 
Indemnity
32.1 The Supplier shall indemnify and hold harmless the 
Purchaser and its employees and officers from and against 
any and all losses, liabilities, and costs (including losses, 
liabilities, and costs incurred in defending a claim alleging 
such a liability), that the Purchaser or its employees or 
officers may suffer as a result of any infringement or alleged 
infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights by reason 
of: 
(a) installation of the System by the Supplier or the use of 
the System, including the Materials, in the country 
where the site is located; 
(b) copying of the Software and Materials provided the 
Supplier in accordance with the Agreement; and 
(c) sale of the products produced by the System in any

GCC Clause 32.2.
32.2 Such indemnity shall not cover any use of the System, 
including the Materials, other than for the purpose indicated 
by or to be reasonably inferred from the Contract, any 
infringement resulting from the use of the System, or any 
products of the System produced thereby in association or 
combination with any other goods or services not supplied 
by the Supplier, where the infringement arises because of 
such association or combination and not because of use of 
the System in its own right.
32.3 Such indemnities shall also not apply if any claim of 
infringement:
(a) is asserted by a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of the 
Purchaser’s organization;
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 107
(b) is a direct result of a design mandated by the 
Purchaser’s Technical Requirements and the possibility 
of such infringement was duly noted in the Supplier’s 
Bid; or
(c) results from the alteration of the System, including the 
Materials, by the Purchaser or any persons other than 
the Supplier or a person authorized by the Supplier.
32.4 If any proceedings are brought or any claim is made against 
the Purchaser arising out of the matters referred to in GCC

notice of such proceedings or claims, and the Supplier may 
at its own expense and in the Purchaser’s name conduct such 
proceedings or claim and any negotiations for the settlement 
of any such proceedings or claim.
If the Supplier fails to notify the Purchaser within twentyeight (28) days after receipt of such notice that it intends to 
conduct any such proceedings or claim, then the Purchaser 
shall be free to conduct the same on its own behalf. Unless 
the Supplier has so failed to notify the Purchaser within the

with any design, data, drawing, specification, or other 
documents or materials provided to the Supplier in 
connection with this Contract by the Purchaser or any

and costs arise as a result of the Supplier’s breach of GCC 
Clause 32.8. 
32.6 Such indemnity shall not cover
108 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
(a) any use of the design, data, drawing, specification, or

data, drawing, specification, or other documents or 
materials, or any products produced thereby, in 
association or combination with any other Goods or 
Services not provided by the Purchaser or any other

materials in its own right.
32.7 Such indemnities shall also not apply:
(a) if any claim of infringement is asserted by a parent, 
subsidiary, or affiliate of the Supplier’s organization;

notice of such proceedings or claims, and the Purchaser may 
at its own expense and in the Supplier’s name conduct such 
proceedings or claim and any negotiations for the settlement 
of any such proceedings or claim. If the Purchaser fails to 
notify the Supplier within twenty-eight (28) days after 
receipt of such notice that it intends to conduct any such 
proceedings or claim, then the Supplier shall be free to 
conduct the same on its own behalf. Unless the Purchaser 
has so failed to notify the Supplier within the twenty-eight 
(28) days, the Supplier shall make no admission that may be 
prejudicial to the defense of any such proceedings or claim.

the Supplier to pay liquidated damages to the 
Purchaser; and
(b) the aggregate liability of the Supplier to the Purchaser, 
whether under the Contract, in tort or otherwise, shall

shall be free to conduct the same on its own behalf. Unless 
the Supplier has so failed to notify the Purchaser within the 
twenty-eight (28) day period, the Purchaser shall make no 
admission that may be prejudicial to the defense of any such

insurance (or copies of the insurance policies) as evidence 
that the required policies are in full force and effect.
37.4 The Supplier shall ensure that, where applicable, its

required export permit(s), including the exercise of due 
diligence in determining the eligibility of the System 
and all of its components for receipt of the necessary 
export permits.
38.2 If either party is prevented, hindered, or delayed from or in 
performing any of its obligations under the Contract by an 
event of Force Majeure, then it shall notify the other in 
writing of the occurrence of such event and the

the performance or punctual performance of its obligations 
under the Contract for so long as the relevant event of Force 
Majeure continues and to the extent that such party’s 
performance is prevented, hindered, or delayed. The Time 
for Achieving Operational Acceptance shall be extended in 
accordance with GCC Clause 40 (Extension of Time for 
Achieving Operational Acceptance).
38.4 The party or parties affected by the event of Force Majeure

H. CHANGE IN CONTRACT ELEMENTS
39. Changes to the 
System
39.1 Introducing a Change
39.1.1 Subject to GCC Clauses 39.2.5 and 39.2.7, the 
Purchaser shall have the right to propose, and 
subsequently require, the Project Manager to order 
the Supplier from time to time during the 
performance of the Contract to make any change, 
modification, addition, or deletion to, in, or from the 
System (interchangeably called “Change”), provided 
that such Change falls within the general scope of
the System, does not constitute unrelated work, and 
is technically practicable, taking into account both 
the state of advancement of the System and the 
technical compatibility of the Change envisaged 
with the nature of the System as originally specified 
in the Contract.
A Change may involve, but is not restricted to, the 
substitution of updated Information Technologies 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 117
and related Services in accordance with 
GCC Clause 23 (Product Upgrades).
39.1.2 The Supplier may from time to time during its 
performance of the Contract propose to the 
Purchaser (with a copy to the Project Manager) any 
Change that the Supplier considers necessary or 
desirable to improve the quality or efficiency of the 
System. The Purchaser may at its discretion 
approve or reject any Change proposed by the 
Supplier.
39.1.3 Notwithstanding GCC Clauses 39.1.1 and 39.1.2, no 
change made necessary because of any default of the 
Supplier in the performance of its obligations under 
the Contract shall be deemed to be a Change, and 
such change shall not result in any adjustment of the 
Contract Price or the Time for Achieving 
Operational Acceptance.
39.1.4 The procedure on how to proceed with and execute 
Changes is specified in GCC Clauses 39.2 and 39.3, 
and further details and sample forms are provided in 
the Sample Forms Section in the Bidding 
Documents.
39.1.5 Moreover, the Purchaser and Supplier will agree, 
during development of the Project Plan, to a date 
prior to the scheduled date for Operational 
Acceptance, after which the Technical Requirements 
for the System shall be “frozen.” Any Change 
initiated after this time will be dealt with after 
Operational Acceptance.
39.2 Changes Originating from Purchaser
39.2.1 If the Purchaser proposes a Change pursuant to GCC 
Clauses 39.1.1, it shall send to the Supplier a 
“Request for Change Proposal,” requiring the 
Supplier to prepare and furnish to the Project 
Manager as soon as reasonably practicable a 
“Change Proposal,” which shall include the 
following:
(a) brief description of the Change;
(b) impact on the Time for Achieving Operational 
Acceptance;
118 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
(c) detailed estimated cost of the Change;
(d) effect on Functional Guarantees (if any);
(e) effect on any other provisions of the Contract.
39.2.2 Prior to preparing and submitting the “Change 
Proposal,” the Supplier shall submit to the Project 
Manager an “Change Estimate Proposal,” which 
shall be an estimate of the cost of preparing the 
Change Proposal, plus a first approximation of the 
suggested approach and cost for implementing the 
changes. Upon receipt of the Supplier’s Change 
Estimate Proposal, the Purchaser shall do one of the 
following:
(a) accept the Supplier’s estimate with instructions 
to the Supplier to proceed with the preparation 
of the Change Proposal;
(b) advise the Supplier of any part of its Change 
Estimate Proposal that is unacceptable and 
request the Supplier to review its estimate;
(c) advise the Supplier that the Purchaser does not 
intend to proceed with the Change.
39.2.3 Upon receipt of the Purchaser’s instruction to 
proceed under GCC Clause 39.2.2 (a), the Supplier 
shall, with proper expedition, proceed with the 
preparation of the Change Proposal, in accordance 
with GCC Clause 39.2.1. The Supplier, at its 
discretion, may specify a validity period for the 
Change Proposal, after which if the Purchaser and 
Supplier has not reached agreement in accordance 
with GCC Clause 39.2.6, then GCC Clause 39.2.7 
shall apply.
39.2.4 The pricing of any Change shall, as far as 
practicable, be calculated in accordance with the 
rates and prices included in the Contract. If the 
nature of the Change is such that the Contract rates 
and prices are inequitable, the parties to the Contract 
shall agree on other specific rates to be used for 
valuing the Change.
39.2.5 If before or during the preparation of the Change 
Proposal it becomes apparent that the aggregate 
impact of compliance with the Request for Change 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 119
Proposal and with all other Change Orders that have 
already become binding upon the Supplier under this 
GCC Clause 39 would be to increase or decrease the 
Contract Price as originally set forth in Article 2 
(Contract Price) of the Contract Agreement by more 
than fifteen (15) percent, the Supplier may give a 
written notice of objection to this Request for 
Change Proposal prior to furnishing the Change 
Proposal. If the Purchaser accepts the Supplier’s 
objection, the Purchaser shall withdraw the proposed 
Change and shall notify the Supplier in writing of its 
acceptance.
The Supplier’s failure to so object to a Request for 
Change Proposal shall neither affect its right to 
object to any subsequent requested Changes or 
Change Orders, nor affect its right to take into 
account, when making such subsequent objection, 
the percentage increase or decrease in the Contract 
Price that any Change not objected to by the 
Supplier represents.
39.2.6 Upon receipt of the Change Proposal, the Purchaser 
and the Supplier shall mutually agree upon all 
matters contained in the Change Proposal. Within 
fourteen (14) days after such agreement, the 
Purchaser shall, if it intends to proceed with the 
Change, issue the Supplier a Change Order. If the 
Purchaser is unable to reach a decision within 
fourteen (14) days, it shall notify the Supplier with 
details of when the Supplier can expect a decision. 
If the Purchaser decides not to proceed with the 
Change for whatever reason, it shall, within the said 
period of fourteen (14) days, notify the Supplier 
accordingly. Under such circumstances, the 
Supplier shall be entitled to reimbursement of all 
costs reasonably incurred by it in the preparation of 
the Change Proposal, provided that these do not 
exceed the amount given by the Supplier in its 
Change Estimate Proposal submitted in accordance 
with GCC Clause 39.2.2.
39.2.7 If the Purchaser and the Supplier cannot reach 
agreement on the price for the Change, an equitable 
adjustment to the Time for Achieving Operational 
Acceptance, or any other matters identified in the 
Change Proposal, the Change will not be 
120 Section IV. General Conditions of Contract
implemented. However, this provision does not 
limit the rights of either party under GCC Clause 6 
(Settlement of Disputes).
39.3 Changes Originating from Supplier
If the Supplier proposes a Change pursuant to GCC 
Clause 39.1.2, the Supplier shall submit to the Project 
Manager a written “Application for Change Proposal,” 
giving reasons for the proposed Change and including the 
information specified in GCC Clause 39.2.1. Upon receipt 
of the Application for Change Proposal, the parties shall 
follow the procedures outlined in GCC Clauses 39.2.6 and 
39.2.7. However, should the Purchaser choose not to 
proceed or the Purchaser and the Supplier cannot come to 
agreement on the change during any validity period that the 
Supplier may specify in its Application for Change Proposal, 
the Supplier shall not be entitled to recover the costs of 
preparing the Application for Change Proposal, unless 
subject to an agreement between the Purchaser and the 
Supplier to the contrary.
40. Extension of 
Time for 
Achieving 
Operational 
Acceptance
40.1 The time(s) for achieving Operational Acceptance specified 
in the Schedule of Implementation shall be extended if the 
Supplier is delayed or impeded in the performance of any of 
its obligations under the Contract by reason of any of the 
following:
(a) any Change in the System as provided in GCC 
Clause 39 (Change in the Information System);
(b) any occurrence of Force Majeure as provided in GCC 
Clause 38 (Force Majeure); 
(c) default of the Purchaser; or
(d) any other matter specifically mentioned in the 
Contract;
by such period as shall be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances and as shall fairly reflect the delay or 
impediment sustained by the Supplier.
40.2 Except where otherwise specifically provided in the 
Contract, the Supplier shall submit to the Project Manager a 
notice of a claim for an extension of the time for achieving 
Operational Acceptance, together with particulars of the 
event or circumstance justifying such extension as soon as 
reasonably practicable after the commencement of such 
Section IV. General Conditions of Contract 121
event or circumstance. As soon as reasonably practicable 
after receipt of such notice and supporting particulars of the 
claim, the Purchaser and the Supplier shall agree upon the 
period of such extension. In the event that the Supplier does 
not accept the Purchaser’s estimate of a fair and reasonable 
time extension, the Supplier shall be entitled to refer the 
matter to the provisions for the Settlement of Disputes 
pursuant to GCC Clause 6.
40.3 The Supplier shall at all times use its reasonable efforts to 
minimize any delay in the performance of its obligations 
under the Contract.
41. Termination 41.1 Termination for Purchaser’s Convenience
41.1.1 The Purchaser may at any time terminate the 
Contract for any reason by giving the Supplier a 
notice of termination that refers to this GCC 
Clause 41.1.
41.1.2 Upon receipt of the notice of termination under GCC 
Clause 41.1.1, the Supplier shall either as soon as 
reasonably practical or upon the date specified in the 
notice of termination
(a) cease all further work, except for such work as 
the Purchaser may specify in the notice of 
termination for the sole purpose of protecting 
that part of the System already executed, or any 
work required to leave the site in a clean and 
safe condition;
(b) terminate all subcontracts, except those to be 
assigned to the Purchaser pursuant to GCC 
Clause 41.1.2 (d) (ii) below;
(c) remove all Supplier’s Equipment from the site, 
repatriate the Supplier’s and its Subcontractors’ 
personnel from the site, remove from the site any

Technical Requirements
A. BACKGROUND
1.0 The Purchaser
1.1 The Republic of Zambia in the field of public procurement, in recent years has made 
a significant progress especially in the field of legislation as the Public Procurement Act No. 
12 of 2008 was enacted by the Parliament of Zambia and became operational on 8 December, 
2008 with major reform tool of procurement reform through decentralization of procurement 
by allowing procuring entities to procure themselves. The Act established Zambia Public 
Procurement Authority (ZPPA) renaming existing Zambia National Tender Board. The 
ZPPA is an independent regulatory body with responsibility for policy, regulation, standard 
setting, compliance and performance monitoring, professional development, information 
management and dissemination in the field of public procurement. In line with the Act, the 
Public Procurement Regulations were released in 2011 through a Statutory Instrument. From 
January 1, 2013, ZPPA stopped handling procurements on behalf of Procuring Entities (PEs). 
PEs with capacity undertake all procurement within their respective institutions. To facilitate 
these PEs for their compliance to the Act and Regulations, improve efficiency, enhance 
transparency, provide equity through competitive bidding, and adhere value for money in all 
procurements are major challenges for Zambia at this early stage. In order to support the 
effort of the government in modernizing the public procurement to achieve basic objectives 
and help enhance good governance in the public procurement sector, the Cooperating 
Partners-financed Zambia: Public Financial Management Reform Programme (PFMRP) 
includes a component for improving the Electronic Procurement System of the Republic of 
Zambia. 
Zambia’s recent economic performance has been encouraging with a decade of rapid 
economic expansion with growth rates averaging 6 percent per annum during the latter half 
of 2000s. In 2013 Zambia’s real GDP is projected to grow at 6.0 percent, much lower than 
the initially projected 7.8 percent.
Despite significant progress, there is still a lot of rooms for improvements in the public 
procurement system, in particular in the field of electronic services of public procurement (eprocurement). To date information portal is available, which offers basic information relating 
to the public procurement act, regulations, circulars, templates, standard solicitation 
documents, and basic guides to bidders. 
The e-procurement system will support procuring entities to purchase goods, works and 
services faster and more efficiently and, more generally, increase the efficiency and 
effectiveness of public procurement. 
The component for e-Procurement System includes the enhancement of existing ZPPA 
website, development of an end-to-end e-Procurement system with all processes involved in 
procurement lifecycle and supported by Public Procurement Act and Public Procurement 
Regulations, international best practices including framework agreements, and support to 
establish e-procurement data center as well as required capacity building activities. 
152 Section VI. Technical Requirements
To this end the project seeks to procure and implement an e-Procurement system for the 
Republic of Zambia to be used by all the stakeholders for the procurement of goods, works 
and services in compliance with the Public Procurement Acts, Regulations, and other 
subsequent amendments; enhance ZPPA website and establish e-Procurement data center.
The e-Procurement Software supplier has two options for delivery of the e-Procurement 
software component. The e-Procurement System can be custom developed or can deliver 
of a commercial Off-The-Shelf e-procurement solution with required customization and 
configuration. In either case, the e-Procurement system shall comply with all the business, 
technical and functional requirements stipulated in this document and other requirements 
identified and mutually agreed by the Supplier and the Purchaser.
1.2 Major Stakeholders and some definitions
The ZPPA will be the lead agency for the operation of e-Procurement System in the Republic 
of Zambia. All other PEs, and relevant government agencies, third party service providers, 
Attorney General, National Council for Construction (NCC) and others will have their own 
dedicated administrative dashboard in the e-Procurement System to carry out their mandated 
functional activities available in the e-Procurement System. 
Zambia Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA): The ZPPA is an independent regulatory 
body with responsibility for policy, regulation, standard setting, compliance and performance 
monitoring, professional development, information management and dissemination in the 
field of public procurement.
Attorney-General (AG): Procuring Entity, before entering into any international agreement 
relating to procurement, should obtain the approval of the authority and advice of the 
Attorney-General. Any agreement purportedly entered into without the approval of the 
Attorney-General is void.
National Council for Construction (NCC): The National Council for Construction (NCC) 
is a statutory body set up under the National Council for Construction Act No. 13 of 2003 
with the responsibility of providing for the promotion, development, training and regulation 
of the construction industry in Zambia. Under the Act, the NCC is further charged with the 
responsibility of registering of contractors, affiliation of professional bodies or organizations 
whose members are engaged in activities related to the construction industry and to provide 
for matters connected with or incidental to the foregoing.
Appeals Committee (AP): The Appeals Committee (AP) a complaints review committee 
formed under the ZPPA. It reviews all complaints addressed to the ZPPA in the field of 
public procurement concerning possible violation of the law.
Deviation Committee (DC): The Deviations Committee (DC) is a committee formed 
under ZPPA. It reviews applications for deviations and accreditation of alternative 
procurement systems.
Procuring Entity (PE): The Procuring Entity (PE) in Zambia means a Government agency 
or parastatal body, or any other body or unit established and mandated by Government to 
carry out procurement using public fund. A PE shall be responsible for the management of all 
Section VI. Technical Requirements 153
procurement activities within its jurisdiction. There are 257 Procuring Entities in Zambia. 
According to the act, the PE shall consist of:
a) a Controlling Officer or Chief Executive Officer;
b) a Procurement Committee;
c) a Procurement Unit; and
d) User departments.
Bidder: Bidder means a person or group of persons that offers to provide goods, works or 
services in response to an invitation from a procuring entity and includes, where applicable, a 
potential bidder and applicant to pre-qualify.
2.0 Business Objectives of the Purchaser
Public procurement is a key aspect of public administration that links the public financial 
system with social and economic outcomes, and as such is a major determinant of the 
effectiveness of the government, and of the quality of public services and infrastructure. 
e-Procurement will create a procurement platform, based on the successful experience of the 
international best practice. The objective of this activity is to make the procurement more 
efficient, using the benefits of today’s electronic technology with a higher level of trust from 
the business sector and the public at large, based on demonstrating fair play, value for 
money, open competition, and accountability. 
e-Procurement acts as a catalyst to wider public sector reform, offering many advantages of 
wider economic benefits, by providing greater management control and significant 
reductions in acquisition costs on a sustainable basis. It represents both an opportunity for 
procurement reform and a change in the way procurement is conducted. The application of 
technology to this area of the public sector has been recognized by many governments as one of the 
most effective means for promoting efficiency and transparency in public procurement. 
The Republic of Zambia has laid out its public sector procurement policy based on the guiding 
principles, which include (i) economy; (ii) competition; (iii) efficiency; (iv) fairness; (v) transparency; 
(vi) accountability; and (vii) value for money. 
2.1 The e-Procurement system will provide a single portal to the Republic of Zambia and bring 
under electronic environment activities performed by the procurement related stakeholders by 
integrating them on a single electronic network. 
Among the key benefits the system will bring is a reduction in the administrative cost, eliminate 
costly overheads and thus further speed up the procurement process, greater transparency of the 
process, better access to information and improved accuracy of procurements. The introduction of the 
e-procurement system will require extensive training of public personnel and bidding community. 
The ZPPA will operate the e-Procurement system. The ZPPA holds the complete operation and 
management responsibility of e-Procurement System in coordination with all Procuring Entities and 
stakeholders (i.e. Attorney-General, National Council for Construction (NCC), Banks and e-payment 
operators, and others) for the implementation of e-Procurement System.
The objectives of this assignment require a consultant to work with the ZPPA and stakeholders to 
develop and implement an e-Procurement system for the Republic of Zambia. The system, under this 
project, will manage the procurement process and government purchases online; from the preparation 
154 Section VI. Technical Requirements
of annual procurement plan publication, advertising of bid notices to contract management and other 
related procurement processes. The e-Procurement system to be developed will have the following 
capabilities to carry out complete public procurements electronically, and include major modules but 
not limited to:
 Registration system for Procuring Entities, and other users; 
Design interface/Integrate with Contractor Registration System of the 
National Council for Construction (NCC), and develop supplier and 
Consultants Registration to be operated by ZPPA;
 User-specific Administrative Dashboards;
 E-Bidding (covering processes and procurement methods supported by public 
procurement law and regulations of the country from Annual Procurement 
Plan to signing of contract); 
 Simplified Bidding (e-Quoting);
 Framework Agreements and their management;
 Contract Management;
 Complaint Procedures handling;
 E-Procurement Management and Performance Monitoring System (ePMPMS);
 User Activities and System Audit trails, and

G. TECHNICAL RESPONSIVENESS CHECKLIST
Note on Preparation of the Checklist for Purchasers: The following is a sample format that is 
designed to help Bidders quickly understand: 
(a) the Technical Specification given in the Technical Requirements; 
(b) whether each Requirement is mandatory or only “preferred”; and 
(c) to ensure that each Bidder includes along with a specific response to the Purchaser, a 
cross reference to the supporting information provided elsewhere in its Technical 
Bid. 
It is important that the tables be prepared carefully and completely, with accurate references to the 
relevant section and paragraph numbers in the Technical Requirements so that Bidders will be more 
likely to submit complete information, particularly regarding the mandatory and scored 
Requirements. In preparing each Checklist entry, Purchasers shall start with an abbreviated text of 
each Requirement so that Bidders can quickly confirm that they are responding to the right 
Requirement. Inconsistencies between the Checklist and the referenced section in the Technical 
Requirements shall be avoided. Giving Bidders a revisable, “electronic” version of the Checklist as 
part of the Bidding Document will enhance the completeness of bids.
216 Section VI. Technical Requirements
Technical Responsiveness Checklist
Note to Bidders: The following Checklist is provided to help the Bidder organize and 
consistently present its Technical Bid. For each of the following Technical Requirements, 
the Bidder must describe how its Technical Bid responds to each Requirement. In addition, 
the Bidder must provide cross references to the relevant supporting information, if any, 
included in the bid. The cross reference shall identify the relevant document(s), page 
number(s), and paragraph(s). The Technical Responsiveness Checklist does not supersede 
the rest of the Technical Requirements (or any other part of the Bidding Documents). If a 
requirement is not mentioned in the Checklist that does not relieve the Bidder from the 
responsibility of including supporting evidence of compliance with that other requirement in

SECTION VII. SAMPLE FORMS
Notes to Bidders on working with the Sample Forms
The Purchaser has prepared the forms in this section of the Bidding Documents to suit 
the specific requirements of the System being procured. They are derived from the forms 
contained in the World Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents for the Supply and Installation 
of Information Systems. In its bid, the Bidder must use these forms (or forms that present in 
the same sequence substantially the same information). Bidders shall not introduce changes 
without the Purchaser’s prior written consent (which may also require the clearance of the 
World Bank). If the Bidder has a question regarding the meaning or appropriateness of the 
contents or format of the forms and/or the instructions contained in them, these questions 
shall be brought to the Purchaser’s attention as soon as possible during the bid clarification 
process, either at the pre-bid meeting or by addressing them to the Purchaser in writing 
pursuant to ITB Clause 10.
The Purchaser has tried to provide explanatory text and instructions to help the 
Bidder prepare the forms accurately and completely. The instructions that appear directly on 
the forms themselves are indicated by use of typographical aides such as italicized text within 
square brackets as is shown in the following example taken from the Bid Submission Form:
Duly authorized to sign this bid for and on behalf of [ insert: name of Bidder ]
In preparing its bid, the Bidder must ensure all such information is provided and that 
the typographical aides are removed.
The sample forms provide a standard set of documents that support the procurement 
process as it moves forward from the stage of bidding, through Contract formation and onto 
Contract performance. The first set of forms must be completed and submitted as part of the 
bid prior to the deadline for bid submission. These include: (i) the Bid Submission Form; (ii) 
the Price Schedules; (iii) the Manufacturer’s Authorizations and key Subcontractor 
agreements; (iv) the List of Proposed Subcontractors; (v) the form(s) for securing the bid (if 
and as required); and other forms as found in sub-sections 1 through 4 of this Section VII of 
the Bidding Documents.
 Bid Submission Form: In addition to being the place where official confirmation of 
the bid price, the currency breakdown, the completion date(s), and other important 
Contract details are expressed, the Bid Submission Form is also used by the Bidder to 
confirm - in case adjudication applies in this Contract - its acceptance of the 
Purchaser’s proposed Adjudicator, or to propose an alternative. If the bid is being 
submitted on behalf of a Joint Venture, it is essential that the Bid Submission Form be 
signed by the partner in charge and that it be supported by the authorizations and 
power of attorney required pursuant to ITB Clause 6.2. Given widespread concern 
about illegal use of licensed software, Bidders will be asked to certify in the Bid 
Submission Form that either the Software included in the bid was developed and is 
owned by the Bidder, or, if not, the Software is covered by valid licenses with the 
proprietor of the Software.
230 Section VII. Sample Forms
 Price Schedules: The prices quoted in the Price Schedules shall constitute full and fair 
compensation for supply, installation, and achieving Operational Acceptance of the 
System as described in the Technical Requirements based on the Implementation 
Schedule, and the terms and conditions of the proposed Contract as set forth in the 
Bidding Documents. Prices shall be given for each line item provided in the 
Schedules, with costs carefully aggregated first at the Subsystem level and then for 
the entire System. If the Price Schedules provide only a summary breakdown of 
items and components, or do not cover some items unique to the Bidder’s specific 
technical solution, the Bidder may extend the Schedules to capture those items or 
components. If supporting price and cost tables are needed for a full understanding of 
the bid, they shall be included.
Arithmetical errors shall be avoided. If they occur, the Purchaser will correct them 
according to ITB Clause 26.2 (ITB Clause 38.2 in the two-stage SBD) without 
consulting the Bidder. Major omissions, inconsistencies, or lack of substantiating 
detail can lead to rejection of a bid for commercial non-responsiveness. Presenting 
prices according to the breakdown prescribed in the Price Schedules is also essential 
for another reason. If a bid does not separate prices in the prescribed way, and, as a 
result, the Purchaser cannot apply the domestic preference provision described in ITB 
Clause 29 (ITB Clause 41 in the two-stage SBD), if they are applicable in this 
bidding, the Bidder will lose the benefit of the preference. Once bids are opened, 
none of these problems can be rectified. At that stage, Bidders are not permitted to 
change their bid prices to overcome errors or omissions.
 Manufacturer’s Authorizations and written agreements by key Subcontractors: In 
accordance with ITB Clauses 6.1 (b) and (c), a Bidder may be required to submit, as 
part of its bid, Manufacturer’s Authorizations in the format provided in the Bidding 
Documents, and agreements by Subcontractors proposed for key services, for all 
items specified in the Bid Data Sheet. There is no particular format (or sample form) 
for Subcontractor agreements.
 List of Proposed Subcontractors: In accordance with ITB Clause 6.3, a Bidder must 
submit, as part of its bid, a list of proposed subcontracts for major items of 
Technologies, Goods, and/or Services. The list shall also include the names and 
places of registration of the Subcontractors proposed for each item and a summary of 
their qualifications.
 List of Software and Materials: In accordance with ITB Clause 13.1 (e) (vi) (ITB 
Clauses 13.1 (c) (vi) and 25.1 (e) (vi) in the two-stage SBD), Bidders must submit, as 
part of their bids, lists of all the Software included in the bid assigned to one of the 
following categories: (A) System, General-Purpose, or Application Software; or 
(B) Standard or Custom Software. Bidders must also submit a list of all Custom 
Materials. If provided for in the Bid Data Sheet, the Purchaser may reserve the right 
to reassign certain key Software to a different category.
 Qualification information forms: In accordance with ITB Clause 6, the Purchaser 
will determine whether the Bidder is qualified to undertake the Contract. This entails 
financial, technical as well as performance history criteria which are specified in the 
BDS for ITB Clause 6. The Bidder must provide the necessary information for the 
Section VII. Sample Forms 231
Purchaser to make this assessment through the forms in this sub-section. The forms 
contain additional detailed instructions which the Bidder must follow.
 Securing the bid: If the BDS for ITB Clause 17 (ITB Clause 29 in the two-stage 
SBD) requires that bids be secured, the Bidder shall do so in accordance with the type 
and details specified in the same ITB/BDS Clause, either using the form(s) included 
in these Sample Forms or using another form acceptable to the Purchaser. If a Bidder 
wishes to use an alternative form, it shall ensure that the revised format provides 
substantially the same protection as the standard format; failing that, the Bidder runs 
the risk of rejection for commercial non-responsiveness.
Bidders need not provide the Performance Security and Advance Payment Security 
with their bids. Only the Bidder selected for award by the Purchaser will be required to 
provide these securities.
The following forms are to be completed and submitted by the successful Bidder 
following notification of award: (i) Contract Agreement, with all Appendices; 
(ii) Performance Security; and (iii) Advance Payment Security.
 Contract Agreement: In addition to specifying the parties and the Contract Price, the 
Contract Agreement is where the: (i) Supplier Representative; (ii) if applicable, 
agreed Adjudicator and his/her compensation; and (iii) the List of Approved 
Subcontractors are specified. In addition, modifications to the successful Bidder’s 
Bid Price Schedules are attached to the Agreement. These contain corrections and 
adjustments to the Supplier’s bid prices to correct errors, adjust the Contract Price to 
reflect – if applicable - any extensions to bid validity beyond the last day of original 
bid validity plus 56 days, etc.
 Performance Security: Pursuant to GCC Clause 13.3, the successful Bidder is 
required to provide the Performance Security in the form contained in this section of 
these Bidding Documents and in the amount specified in accordance with the SCC.
 Advance Payment Security: Pursuant to GCC Clause 13.2, the successful Bidder is 
required to provide a bank guarantee for the full amount of the Advance Payment - if 
an Advance Payment is specified in the SCC for GCC 12.1 - in the form contained in 
this section of these Bidding Documents or another form acceptable to the Purchaser. 
If a Bidder wishes to propose a different Advance Payment Security form, it shall 
submit a copy to the Purchaser promptly for review and confirmation of acceptability 
before the bid submission deadline.
The Purchaser and Supplier will use the following additional forms during Contract 
implementation to formalize or certify important Contract events: (i) the Installation and 
Operational Acceptance Certificates; and (ii) the various Change Order forms. These and the 
procedures for their use during performance of the Contract are included in the Bidding 
Documents for the information of Bidders.

2. PRICE SCHEDULE FORMS
Note: in information systems procurement, the Contract Price (and payment schedule) shall be linked 
as much as possible to achievement of operational capabilities, not just to the physical delivery of 
technology. 
Section VII. Sample Forms 239
2.1 Preamble
Note: Purchasers shall highlight any special requirements of the System and Contract in a Preamble 
to the Price Schedules. The following is an example of one such preamble.
General
1. The Price Schedules are divided into separate Schedules as follows:
2.2 Grand Summary Cost Table
2.3 Supply and Installation Cost Summary Table
2.4 Recurrent Cost Summary Table
2.5 Supply and Installation Cost Sub-Table(s)
2.6 Recurrent Cost Sub-Tables(s)
2.7 Country of Origin Code Table
[ insert: any other Schedules as appropriate ]
2. The Schedules do not generally give a full description of the information technologies 
to be supplied, installed, and operationally accepted, or the Services to be performed 
under each item. However, it is assumed that Bidders shall have read the Technical 
Requirements and other sections of these Bidding Documents to ascertain the full scope 
of the requirements associated with each item prior to filling in the rates and prices. 
The quoted rates and prices shall be deemed to cover the full scope of these Technical 
Requirements, as well as overhead and profit.
3. If Bidders are unclear or uncertain as to the scope of any item, they shall seek 
clarification in accordance with the Instructions to Bidders in the Bidding Documents 
prior to submitting their bid.
Pricing
4. Prices shall be filled in indelible ink, and any alterations necessary due to errors, etc., 
shall be initialed by the Bidder. As specified in the Bid Data Sheet, prices shall be 
fixed and firm for the duration of the Contract.
5. Bid prices shall be quoted in the manner indicated and in the currencies specified in 
ITB Clauses 14 and 15 (ITB Clauses 27 and 28 in the two-stage SBD). Prices must 
correspond to items of the scope and quality defined in the Technical Requirements or 
elsewhere in these Bidding Documents.
6. The Bidder must exercise great care in preparing its calculations, since there is no 
opportunity to correct errors once the deadline for submission of bids has passed. A 
single error in specifying a unit price can therefore change a Bidder’s overall total bid 
price substantially, make the bid noncompetitive, or subject the Bidder to possible loss. 
240 Section VII. Sample Forms
The Purchaser will correct any arithmetic error in accordance with the provisions of 
ITB Clause 26.2 (ITB Clause 38.2 in the two-stage SBD).
7. Payments will be made to the Supplier in the currency or currencies indicated under 
each respective item. As specified in ITB Clause 15.1 (ITB Clause 28.1 in the twostage SBD), no more than three foreign currencies may be used. The price of an item 
shall be unique regardless of installation site.
